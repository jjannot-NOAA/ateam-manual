    "text": "A Code of Conduct is a set of basic ground rules that we ask participants in lab spaces to follow. The goal is to create an open and inclusive space for our work that helps us achieve our collective goals. Along with our lab culture/philosophy, it also provides a benchmark for self-evaluation and helps better define our identity as a community.\nOur code of conduct has been reviewed by the SMAST Dean’s Office and by UMassD Human Resources and office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.\nWe expect all lab members to adhere to the policies and guidelines outlined here.\nAdditional information and resources can be found in the SMAST Code of Conduct and Diversity Statement.\n\n\nThe Fay lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form and prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort.\nThis code of conduct applies to all Fay lab spaces, including group and individual meetings (face to face and remote), workshops, social events, email correspondence, and web channels and code repositories, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned and referred to the university’s academic policies. Some Fay lab spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.\n\n\n\nThe Fay lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of group members or others in our larger communities in any form. Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth’s Equal Opportunity and Anti-Harassment policies, complaint procedures and form provides definitions and examples of harassment and sexual harassment.\nThis code of conduct applies to all Fay lab spaces, including group and individual meetings (face to face and remote), workshops, social get togethers, email correspondence, and web channels and code repositories, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned and referred to the School’s and university’s academic policies.\nSome Fay lab spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.\nHarassment includes:\n\nOffensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.\n\nUnwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.\nDeliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.\nGratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.\nPhysical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.\nThreats of violence.\nIncitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.\nDeliberate intimidation.\nStalking or following.\nHarassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.\nSustained disruption of discussion.\nUnwelcome sexual attention.\nPattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others\nContinued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.\nDeliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.\nPublication of non-harassing private communication.\n\nThe Fay lab prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The PI (Gavin Fay) reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:\n\n‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’\nReasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”\nCommunicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial\nCriticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions\n\n\n\nIf you are being harassed by a member of the Fay lab, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the PI, Dr. Gavin Fay, at gfay@umassd.edu. If you do not wish to contact Dr. Fay, please contact Department Chair Dr. Steve Cadrin scadrin@umassd.edu and/or SMAST Assistant Dean Mike Marino mmarino@umassd.edu. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.\nLab members who believe they have been subjected to any kind of discrimination that conflicts with the University of Massachusetts’ policies and/or the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ should seek assistance from a supervisor or an HR representative. Information about the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth’s Equal Opportunity and Anti-Harassment policies, complaint procedures and form.\nConfidentiality: Please remember that by way of his position at the university, Dr. Fay is a mandated reporter under Title IX. This means that he is not allowed to keep matters falling under Title IX confidential, and is required to disclose these incidents to the administration. You are welcome to discuss matters with Dr. Fay, but please keep this in mind when doing so. Gavin will do his best to remind you of his responsibilities at the start of conversations anticipated to relate to these topics. If you would prefer to discuss incidents of harassment that fall under Title IX with a confidential source, you can contact David Gomes, UMass Dartmouth Director of Diversity and Inclusion.\nThis code of conduct applies to Fay lab spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of the Fay lab or another member of the SMAST community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Fay lab members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the Fay lab based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Fay lab spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Fay lab. The University Counseling Center provides a range of services to help students develop improved coping skills to address emotional, interpersonal and academic concerns.\nTo protect our team members from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.\nThe above caveats noted, we will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse when possible. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the Fay lab members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.\n\n\n\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.\nIf a participant engages in harassing behavior, Dr. Fay may take any action they deem appropriate, which includes referral to the Department Chair and Dean’s Office under the SMAST policy, and also including expulsion from all Fay lab spaces.\n\n\n\nOther University of Massachusetts Board of Trustees and University documents:\n\nPolicy Against Intolerance\nPrinciples of Employee Conduct\nResolution in Support of Pluralism\nNon-Discrimination and Harassment Policy\nStatement of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity\nStatement on Cultural Diversity and Inclusion\nStatement on Gender Discrimination\nBully, Harassment and Violence\nStudent Conduct Policies and Procedures\nSexual Harassment Policy\nTitle IX and Sexual Assault/Harassment\n\n\n\n\n\nThis anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy created by the Geek Feminism community.

    "text": "Welcome to the Fay Lab at UMass Dartmouth!\n\nHere are some resources to help you get settled into the Lab.\nOur group is excited that you have decided to join our team! We hope that these onboarding resources, guidelines, and tips will make your transition to SMAST seamless and enjoyable. Most importantly, welcome!\nIf you are already a student, post-doc, or researcher we hope these resources prove useful as well.\n\n\nSMAST related resources, forms, policies, procedures, calendars, as well as job aids are housed on the SMAST Occupants page of your myUMassD portal. For everyone in the SMAST community, a link to the SMAST Occupants page will appear under the “MyUMassD Sites” list on the right-hand side of the myUmassD landing page (if this is not visible to you, let Ashleigh know).\n\n\n\nA work in progress.\n\nIT Help for new students and staff/faculty\nHere, you can navigate to the “Are you new?” section and select either student or staff.\n\n\n\n\nWithin the first few weeks of joining the Fay Lab, you should work with Gavin to develop a plan outlining your short, medium, and long term goals. More on individual developing plans can be found in Chapter @ref(expectations).\n\n\n\n(graduate students do not need to complete timesheets)\nYou can access you timesheets through the HR portal in. Navigate to Quicklaunch and click on HRDirect. You need to enter your UMassD user ID, password, and select the Dartmouth campus. If this is the first time you do this, you will also need to verify your account through DUO authorization. We recommend using the DUO app on your phone. You can choose to have push access, or send codes. After your initial setup, you can also opt to go through DUO 1/month (instead of every time you login to HRDirect).\nEven if you are salaried, it’s still important to keep track of and submit your vacation and sick time!\n\n\n\nCurrently all work in the lab is being performed remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All access to SMAST facilities requires prior approval from Gavin, Mike Marino, and Eric Lyonnais. No work is to be performed on site until further notice.\n\n\nOur physical lab space is in the SMAST-East (new) building. The lab is room 245. Ashleigh’s desk is in the lab. Gavin’s office is room 228.\nEveryone in the lab is provided with desk space. Lab members sit either in the lab itself, or in the shared graduate student cubicle space and shared postdoc offices. Gavin encourages people to set up and work where is most comfortable. Graduate students should make use of their allocated space in the shared area but can do computational work in the lab area.\nLab meetings are held either in the lab, or in one of the SMAST-E conference rooms.\n\n\n\nAccess to the SMAST building, and to individual lab spaces within the building is through your UMass Pass keycard. Typically, you will have access to the SMAST gate, SMAST East building, the lab space (room #245), classrooms, and if you are a grad student/postdoc you will have access to the relevant shared office space.\nThe necessary building access forms can be found on the SMAST Occupants page which need to be filled out and approved and signed by Gavin before submitting to Mike Marino and Eric Lyonnais.\n\n\n\nParking at either of the SMAST buildings is free and no parking pass is required. Parking on the main UMassD campus requires a digital parking pass. If you are staff this pass is free, there is a fee for students. Full details for campus parking policies and procedures are on the UMassD parking webpage. Note that there is limited short-term/temporary parking available on campus so you may feel it’s not necessary to obtain a campus parking pass."

    "text": "In addition to agreeing to follow our communities codes of conduct and the university academic integrity policy, we expect everyone in the group to echo our lab culture (Chapter @ref(culture)).\nIndividual mentoring plans: Gavin will work with each of you to develop your individual mentoring plan that serves to ensure your time in the Fay lab progresses your short, medium, and long-term goals. This is a useful planning document that assists in aligning expectations. Graduate students will revisit the mentoring plan during an individual meeting with Gavin at the beginning of each semester & the start of summer. Other lab members will revisit these at appropriate time scales (e.g. every 6 months).\nA template for these, with thanks to @duffy_ma can be found here.\nIn addition, it is useful to have broad (for all lab members) and specific (i.e., grad students, research staff, etc.) expectations of our roles clarified. These are outlined below.\n\n\nGavin generally does not hold people to working a fixed schedule, or to be in the office for a certain schedule. As adults, we should all set the working schedule that is the right fit for us, and it is likely that what this ‘fit’ is will change over the course of the time you are in the lab. Depending on the nature of your appointment, there may be specific hours that will need to be worked and you should work with your main collaborator to outline these.\nGavin generally does not work evenings or on weekends, and does not expect that people in the lab are available at these times. Lab members should also not expect others to be available during these times.\nGraduate students are generally funded on annual research assistantship (RA) stipends. The RA contracts state that this stipend is for 20 hrs of work per week during the academic year and 40 hrs per week during summer to support full time study in the academic program. Most usually, students on RAships are being paid from a research grant where the focus of the grant is the topic the student is working on for their thesis research, so there is overlap here. We believe that training to do the research is part of the job, so this would include courses and additional time to read/learn methods, software too. Some people find that counting ‘billable hours’ is productive for them as it helps them keep accountable to themselves. Others do not find this method useful. Regularly assess what works best for you.\nFull time is enough, and we do not expect team members to work nights and weekends, though do not enforce a particular working hours schedule because students should feel flexible enough to create a work schedule that works for them. Lab members should not expect others to be available during evenings and weekends. There is value to interacting with others as part of your work, and we do expect you will be available during normal working hours for at least some of the time during the week. We also recognize that there will occasionally be times where there is a need to work more to meet a deadline, but this should be the exception - an expectation of overwork is not to be normalized.\n\n\n\nIn the lab, we communicate via email. You should therefore check your email at least once a day during the normal work week. We also make use of Google Docs and issues on GitHub to record institutional knowledge and hold conversations regarding research tasks. Note that being available does not mean that you are available 24/7 - this is not expected. Do not expect responses to emails after regular business hours on weekdays, or on weekends. However, because we recognize that lab members should be able to create a working schedule that is right for them, lab members should not be penalized for sending communication during these times.\n\n\n\nAttendance is expected at:\n\nDepartmental seminars\n\nWeekly lab meetings / quantfish woRkshops\n\nIndividual meetings with Gavin to discuss and work on your research\n\nSMAST thesis and proposal defenses\n\nSMAST all hands meetings / start-and-end of semester events\n\nAnnual UMass Intercampus Marine Science graduate research symposium\n\n\n\n\nWe share our learning and time with others beyond our lab, knowing that this builds community and ultimately improves both the quality and impact of our science. This doesn’t mean individuals do everything, however. We take on leadership roles within SMAST and the university, are supportive of others in our community during their milestones, actively participate in SMAST events (e.g. the IMS graduate research symposium), and perform outreach. Ask others in the lab about activities they are part of, and work with Gavin when crafting your mentoring plan to identify outreach strategy that meshes well with your goals.\n\n\n\nGavin (as PI) will (at a minimum) provide:\n\nTechnical support for analysis (e.g., access to computing, training on techniques)\n\nPositive feedback & constructive criticism on work\n\nProfessional career support\n\nSupport for non-technical aspects of making career progress\n\nRegular meetings (every two weeks) to discuss work & maintain progress on goals\n\nProvide clear and honest appraisal of your funding situation\n\n\n\n\nYou are responsible for your degree. This means you need to stay on top of program and university deadlines, requirements, etc. See Chapter @ref(umassd-resources) & Chapter @ref(smast-resources) for links to resources.\nBefore registering for each semester, you are required to meet with your advisor (Gavin) to review your tracking sheet (SMAST academic milestone document) and discuss plans for the forthcoming semester (classes, activities, etc.).\nCourse of study: Work with Gavin when crafting and revisiting your individual mentoring plans to identify classes that you will take during your academic program. Look beyond those offered at SMAST to include elsewhere at UMassD, the UMass system, and also at other institutions (consider the value of a semester exchange). A list of classes that lab members have taken, and suggested course of study schedule for Fay lab grad students can be found in Chapter @ref(courses).\nWe schedule regular individual meetings with Gavin throughout the year. At a minimum during the semester these will take place every two weeks, although there may be times when more regular meetings are needed. Meetings are a chance for you to get focused time with Gavin to discuss and work on your research. Thus they are your time, not Gavin’s. Come with an agenda with a list of things that you want to accomplish and work on during that time.\nWe share our research at local, national, and international meetings, and publish our findings in the scientific literature. Gavin strives to provide financial support for grad students to attend at least one major conference per year. You should expect to give a presentation (a poster or a talk) on your work at these.\n\n\nGavin does not typically accept students into the lab without being able to guarantee at least 2 years of full funding. Students are encouraged to seek and apply for extramural funding to support their work. This includes scholarships and fellowships to pay for salary, but also smaller grants for travel, workshop attendance, or research costs. There are many opportunities out there, particularly for students. Some resources are outlined in Chapter @ref(funding).\n\n\n\n\nYou will most likely be working with one of the lab’s research team as your primary research supervisor. The grad student or postdoc you are working with on your project will be your primary source of contact and you should work with them to establish and define your work schedule, protocols for your work, and to ensure you have the necessary equipment to perform your work tasks.\nAlthough the grad student / postdoc is your primary contact, always feel like you can reach out to both Gavin as lab PI and Ashleigh as lab manager. We are excited to help you use your position in the lab to further your career goals and want to work with you to help you achieve them.\nIf you are an hourly worker (either federal work study or grant supported) then it is critical that you complete your timesheets through HR Direct with your hours worked, so that you can get paid. Please submit your electronic timesheet each week by noon on Friday, to allow time for Gavin to approve. Alert your research supervisor AND Gavin as soon as possible if there are any complications with regard to pay. We want you to be compensated for your work in a timely fashion.\n\n\n\nPostdocs are independent researchers and likely will have significant collaboration with researchers at other institutions as part of their research and position. Postdocs in the lab may also be sharing time between SMAST and another opportunity.\nIn general, postdocs are expected to:\n\nBe present and involved in lab meetings, workshops, campus seminars, and conferences.\n\nProvide mentorship, technical support, and assistance to other lab members\n\nCommunicate both successes and sticking points on a regular basis with the PI\n\nWork independently and collaboratively\n\nParticipate in professional development opportunities\n\nLead and assist in designated research projects\n\nDevelop and submit proposals to fund future research\n\nOn day 1 of his postdoc at NOAA NEFSC, Gavin’s postdoc advisor said “Your first job is to look for your next job”. While a postdoctoral position is a scienctific research position, it is also a training opportunity and a step to something else, and a full-time permanent position beats a postdoc. Do not feel bad or awkward about pursuing (and taking) employment opportuntities, and also training opportunities that help you move toward that next step. We want you to succeed!\n[As benefited employees at UMass Dartmouth, postdocs are able to enroll in a limited amount of graduate coursework as part of their benefits package. Talk with Gavin about this.]\nPostdocs will likely have active roles on advisory working groups or other professional service roles. If opportunities are not immediately apparent through your funded research, then Gavin can help strategize about where is a useful space to target your involvement.\n\n\n\nMuch like post-docs, research staff operate as independent and collaborative researchers on assigned projects. As these positions are often working directly alongside your mentor/direct collaborator on particular lab projects, meetings may be more frequent than those with others in the lab. Weekly meetings should have clear agendas, and can often be used as collaborative working time to make progress on specific tasks.\nIn general, staff are expected to:\n\nBe present and involved in lab meetings, workshops, campus seminars, and conferences\n\nProvide technical support and assistance to other lab members\nCommunicate both successes and sticking points on a regular basis with PI\nWork independently and collaboratively\nLead and assist in designated research projects\nParticipate in professional development opportunities (i.e., workshops, conferences, submitting previous position manuscripts [without detracting from new position])\nSeek and pursue new funding opportunities when appropriate (this will likely be dependent on your timeline)\nProduce expected output from assigned grants\nBe flexible! Additional projects may be assigned to give additional funding for your position\n\nServe as a role model and go-to resource for other members of the lab\n\nResearch staff positions may be somewhat flexible in scope. For example, the position may include some lab management, leadership, and communication responsibilities. Exact set of responsibilities and duties will be clearly defined in your position description and expectations agreed on in your work plan."

    "text": "Acknowledge communication and engage with others about your work. This includes communication with the lab team, your peers, collaborators, and also communicating your work to others. If someone works on something for you or provides you with feedback on your work, thank them and engage with them on their feedback. Our science improves by engaging with conversations about your work. View such interactions as opportunities to be collaborative rather than evaluative. Chances are if someone asks you questions about your work it is because they are interested in your science.\nAcknowledging communication and thanking others for their work is part of the profession, and it also helps collaboration by continuing conversation.\nWhile our philosophy applies, in that you shouldn’t feel like you have to be on email all the time, don’t let you email inbox become a black hole where questions / thoughts get sucked into and no response emerges.\nWe also believe in being intentional in communicating our work. While publishing and conference presentations are thought of as the standard forms in which science is disseminated, there are a number of ways in which you can communicate your work with others, depending on your audiences and chosen levels of engagement. You should always invest in these at the level that is of interest to you. Here are some things we recommend as members of our team.\n\n\nThis Google Doc resource created and curated by Dr. Sunshine Menezes, the ED of the Metcalf Institute at URI, covers a wide range of topics related to inclusive science communication, education, and public engagement with STEM topics. We suggest you take a look!\n\n\n\nKeep your CV up to date. We share our CVs within the group in this Google Drive folder, both to give each other ideas about what to include, but also having these in one place makes it easier for Gavin and others to reference information from them when needed.\nHere is a link to a lab-chat issue on CV building based on a 05/05/2020 lab meeting.\n\n\nHaving a Google Scholar profile is a very easy way to curate your web presence and have a place where people can find you and your published papers and reports.\nWe recommend everyone sets up a Google Scholar profile as soon as they have a paper or technical report. It takes about 5-10 minutes to set up, and one advantage is that Google Scholar self-updates and will add your papers and citations as you publish and people use your work. This is a really easy step to creating a web presence without having to set up a website.\n\n\n\n\nWhy have your own website?\n\nPeople will Google you. They might as well see what you want them to.\nGive people an easy way to find you and your work.\n\nOne way to do this is a personal website. This doesn’t have to be extensive, but can be a good way to curate your web presence.\nThere are heaps of tools out there to create and publish websites. Our recommendation is to choose something that it is easy to update, and fun / interesting for you to use. Many options are free.\nSome options for creating sites include: GoogleSites, Weebly, Squarespace, WordPress, R Markdown, GitHub.\nWhat should you include?\nUltimately this is up to you and how you would like to present yourself and your work. But some common things you could include are: not an exhaustive list\n\nBioSketch\nResearch interests/overview\nProjects\nPublications\nCV\nBlog posts\nContact info\n\nAn example website (though many amazing others exist and you should check those out): Ashleigh’s webpage using the free version of Weebly\n\n\n\nTwitter is a great tool for interacting with others about your science. It is also a great platform for learning about new research and papers, finding out about jobs and fellowships, learning and discussing methods, discussing topics about how we do science, professional development, mental health and expectations around science and graduate school, and is a great venue for bringing ones whole self to the science. etc. Most of us have our own personal Twitter accounts and use them to varying degress. Everyone in the lab can post to the lab Twitter account too. Ask Ashleigh if you are interested in doing a takeover of thefaylab account for a week (which could also be a chance to dip your toe in to Twitter if you don’t use it).\n[link to paper on use of twitter for rstats!]\n\n\n\n[Link to papers on social media in fisheries ]\nAs you know, there are many social media platforms, and many (all?) of these are being used in some way for science communication. This includes but not limited to:\n\nTwitter\nInstagram\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTikTok\nYoutube\nResearchgate\n\nAll have a different purpose and type of engagement. Think deliberately about how (and if) you want to use these tools. Using social media as part of your science communication portfolio can be useful and is popular, but it is not a requirement to be a successful scientist.\n\n\n\n[more to come on engaging with our local press, etc.]"

    "text": "Because our work is quantitative, research computing skills are an important part of your toolset. Most of our team uses the open source software R for a lot of their workflow, though you probably want to also learn an additional tool during your time in the lab (for many, the natural choice here is TMB and/or ADMB, as these C++ template languages are the basis for many statistical population dynamics models in fisheries stock assessment).\nFortunuately, there are heaps of resources (including your labmates!) to help you with your learning.\n\n\nAs a student of UMass Dartmouth, the Computing and Information Technology Services (CITS) provides access to essential resources and help when you need it. Information on how to set up your UMass login and access the UMassD portal can be found on the New Students UMassD CITS webpage. A list of available programs and licensed software can be found on the Software Licensing page.\n\n\n\nOnce you are set up with your UMass login, you will need to submit an SMAST IT Access Request Form to gain access to the SMAST Server. This form can be found under the SMAST Occupants page, Information Technology section through the UMassD portal. If you have additional questions or issues, you can email SMAST IT through smastsupport@umassd.edu.\n\n\n\nAs your computer is your main piece of lab research equipment, it is important to be able to use it effectively. Please ensure you are familiar with procedures for and have the ability to make changes on your computer as an administrator.\n\n\n\nUMassD uses Zoom as its conference call software solution. Everyone should activate their Zoom Pro account which is part of the university license. Information on how to set this up can be found here.\n\n\n\nFor writing, we collaborate using GoogleDocs. For code and analyses we encourage the use of version control (see Wilson et al. paper for what this could look like), stepping toward the use of git and github for sharing code and analyses. We believe there are many advantages of using these tools to help simplify workflows and shift cognitive load to the science being done rather than on organization and bookkeeping (which computers are good at). Recognizing that these tools represent a learning curve, we provide training in their use, and also encourage alternatives for sharing and documenting work. For example, code and analyses may also be shared among collaborators using a Google Drive folder.\n\n\n\nThe average life expectancy of a hard drive is less than the duration of most graduate programs. Thus it is critical to ensure your data and work are backed up regularly. You may have personal backup solutions (e.g. through Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) but the lab has dedicated storage space on a university server that is backed up in multiple locations. Your data should be backed up on here. For information on logging on and accessing this, see information provided on a GitHub issue\n\n\n\nWelcome to R! There are so many learning resources out there it can feel a little overwhelming in terms of what to choose! To get you set up and started, Happy Git and Github for the useR is a great resource, and is created by the same authors as the now-legendary stat545.com course. Their resources are extremely comprehensive and they have a fantastic Intro R course, especially for those who will be using R for doing statistics.\nRight now, we REALLY like this short intro course by @juliesquid & @allisonhorst. They teach a lot of the workflow and tools around using R right from the get go, which we think is more helpful than knowing how to do all the things. The (excellent) materials are thoughtfully put together, link to a ton of other great resources, and just like the online #rstats community in general, are super supportive of new learners.\nWe also really like:\n\nTeacup Giraffes R and statistics materials from Desirée De Leon and Hasse Walum.\n\nData Science in a Box course by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and\nAdventures in R by Kelly Bodwin.\n\nIf you want a book to work from/through, R for Data Science is highly recommended. (book is free online)\nThe R Studio Education team have assembled a phenomenal array of courses, tutorials, and other materials for learning R, and for many types of data analyses and modeling using R. These are top notch and so thoughtfully put together. There is something for learners at all levels.\nA plug for the online R community. Follow the hashtag #rstats, & also check out accounts @RLadiesGlobal & @R4dsCommunity. The weekly #TidyTuesday social coding project is also a great way to practice your growing R skills. Have fun!\nThe R4dsCommunity Slack is a briliant resource for getting help to your R questions and finding tutorials. They also hold online Office Hours where you can get help with R from a real human.\nThe RStudio Community is a great go-to.\nLearn R from within R with interactive sessions using swirlstats.com.\nThe carpentries R lessons are also a fab resource.\n\n\n\n[resources detail]"

    "text": "Everybody will at some point leave the group. Degrees get completed, jobs are obtained, super exciting! Having a clear offboarding process ensures there are no loose ends when a member leaves the lab, that others who might carry on work being done can do so most easily, and provides an opportunity to clarify any remaining steps (e.g. publication, future collaboartions).\n(with thanks to the Pinsky lab & Bahlai lab!\n\n\nSet up a dedicated time to meet with Gavin and/or your main collaborator (for undergraduate researchers) to talk about your time in the lab, and to go through the below checklist to make sure these have been done. Besides the checklist, things to talk about include the best part of being in our team, whether you got the support you needed and what could we improve for mentoring and training someone in your role in the future. Checklist for students, staff, and post docs\n\n\n\nProject work should be hosted either in a github repository linked to from the faylab account, or saved on the lab_fay server drive (prefereably both).\nEach project should have an easily found README text file that provides information for others so they can navigate and use your work, and give contact information for authors (and any data creators/use restrictions if propietary data). Ideally, the README should also include links to publications and presentations from the work.\n\n\n\nEnsure that publications and presentations from your projects are archived in the appropriate folder on the lab Google Drive.\n\n\n\nData used in support of your projects should be:\n\nSaved in appropriate, non-proprietary format with accompanying metadata\nEither in a public archive (e.g., the github repo or another public archive), or if data is proprietary, a ‘snapshot’ version of the data used in the project should be saved in a private repository accessible to lab members. Alternatively, data could be saved on the lab_fay server drive with appropriate documentation.\nLinked and briefly described in the project README.\n\n\n\n\nCode used or developed for the project should be:\n\ncomplete and well-documented, including information in a README about what each file does and workflow to run the code\nSaved on the lab_fay section of the storage server, and also preferably available on github in a public repository.\n\n\n\n\nScience is not finished until it has been communicated. Hopefully, you will publish your results in the peer-reviewed literature so that others can learn and build from your work. During your exit interview, make a plan with Gavin for remaining publications, including a timeline for submission.\n\n\n\nEnsure any lab equipment (e.g. computer and peripherals) you have been using has been returned to the lab, office furniture is present and accounted for, and that tagged equipment has been logged in with Ashleigh. Make sure any problems with equipment are documented and that Gavin and Ashleigh have been made aware of them.\n\n\n\nReturn all books checked out from the lab library.\n\n\n\nKey card access to the SMAST facilities will be terminated at the end of your contract. During your exit interview, discuss with Gavin whether modifications need to be made to this timeline."

You can find resources related to leave here\n\n\n\nIn most cases, compensatory time can be awarded for travel that occurs outside or beyond normal working hours or days.\nCompensatory time for working (as opposed to traveling) is typically not awarded. Rather, overtime work is typically compensated via overtime pay.\nA quick guide for how to claim and record Compensatory Time can be found here.\n\n\n\n\nSoon after joining the A-Team, you should work with the PM to create an annual, individual Performance Plan. This document will guide your work and will be revisited (in discussions with the PM) during the year and updated to reflect any changes on an annual basis. The exact set of responsibilities, projects, deliverables, and duties will be clearly defined agreed on in your Performance Plan.\nMore about the performance process can be found here.\nThe AFSC Awards page lists the many ways you can be recognized and awarded for your achievements as well as opportunities to nominate your peers for their hard work.\n\n\n\nAFSC buildings on the Seattle Sand Point Campus are only accessible with a CAC during work hours.\n\n\nOur physical offices are in Building 4 of the Seattle Sand Point Campus.\nThe following are FMA A-Team (and affiliated staff) office numbers:\n\n1060 - Jason Jannot, FMA Analytical Services Program Manager\n1057 - Lacey Jeroue, AMMOP Program Manager\n1057 - Andy Kingham, Analyst/IT developer\n1057 - Geoff Mayhew, Research Fishery Biologist\n1056 - Craig Faunce, Research Fisheries Biologist\n1089 - Jennifer Cahalan, Statistician/Analyst\nPhil Ganz, Jason Gasper, Jennifer Mondragon all work in the AKRO in Juneau and work closely with the FMA A-Team.\n\nOther FMA staff offices\n\n1059 - Jennifer Ferdinand, FMA Division Director\n1061 - Lisa Thompson, FMA Deputy Director\n1062 - Marlon Conception, FMA Debriefing Program Manager\n1063 - Brian Mason, FMA Training Program Manager\n\n\n\n\nReservations for rooms or government vehicles can be found here\n\n\n\nTo obtain either a vehicle or a bike parking pass for the Seattle Sand Point Campus, contact Pass & ID Security Office in Building 1 (206-526-6571). You will need to fill out a WRC Parking Form.\n\n\n\nAllows for reimbursement to employees who use a non-motorized bicycle for a substantial portion of travel between your residence and the worksite. Reimbursement can be up to $20 per month, not to exceed $240 per calendar year for bicycle commuting expenses.\nMore information on bike benefits and instructions.\n\n\n\nNOAA offers this non-taxable transit-fare subsidy program to encourage federal employees to use public mass transportation while commuting to and from work. Qualified employees are provided with a monthly benefit based on the distance to and from work. The monthly maximum subsidy transit benefit allowance is $270. Unused benefits do not carry over to the next month.\nMore information on the transit subsidy program and application.\n\n\n\n\nYou are encouraged to set-up an AFSC Contact Card, for example, see Jason’s Contact Card. This is optional and not required but provides a public facing profile so that others within and outside NOAA can find you and can be linked to other social media accounts (e.g., Research Gate, LinkedIn, etc.).

Adopting a service mindset when approaching each other, stakeholders, partners, and collaborators will magnify our positive impacts on commercial fishing and the wider world. Remember, service is the 2nd of the three NOAA mission’s: Science, Service, Stewardship.\nSome ways to adopt a service mindset:\n\nMentor others when appropriate, especially new team members\n\nServe as a role model\n\nServe as a resource for other members of the A-Team\n\nNominate your peers for their hard work and achievements - AFSC Awards page.\nParticipate in outreach activities\n\nProject assignment will be a discussion between individuals and the PM, with input from the A-Team when necessary/appropriate. Specific individual projects, deliverables, duties will be reflected on individual Performance Plans. Other duties that team members might assume, depending on interest, time, Program/Division/Center priorities, and needs include (but are not limited to):\n\nleading and assisting in designated research projects\n\nparticipation in professional development opportunities\n\ndeveloping and submitting research funding proposals\n\nsubmitting and publishing NOAA Technical Memorandum and other reports\n\nsubmitting and publishing peer-reviewed journal articles\nparticipating in outreach activities\n\nattending scientific and professional conferences\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the Program Manager is your primary supervisor, everyone should always feel like they can reach out to anyone else on the A-team for help or collaboration."

    "text": "Because our work is quantitative, research computing skills are an important part of your toolset. Most of our team uses the open source software R for a lot of their workflow, though you probably want to also learn an additional tool during your time in the lab (for many, the natural choice here is TMB and/or ADMB, as these C++ template languages are the basis for many statistical population dynamics models in fisheries stock assessment).\nFortunuately, there are heaps of resources (including your labmates!) to help you with your learning.\n\n\nAs a student of UMass Dartmouth, the Computing and Information Technology Services (CITS) provides access to essential resources and help when you need it. Information on how to set up your UMass login and access the UMassD portal can be found on the New Students UMassD CITS webpage. A list of available programs and licensed software can be found on the Software Licensing page.\n\n\n\nOnce you are set up with your UMass login, you will need to submit an SMAST IT Access Request Form to gain access to the SMAST Server. This form can be found under the SMAST Occupants page, Information Technology section through the UMassD portal. If you have additional questions or issues, you can email SMAST IT through smastsupport@umassd.edu.\n\n\n\nAs your computer is your main piece of lab research equipment, it is important to be able to use it effectively. Please ensure you are familiar with procedures for and have the ability to make changes on your computer as an administrator.\n\n\n\nUMassD uses Zoom as its conference call software solution. Everyone should activate their Zoom Pro account which is part of the university license. Information on how to set this up can be found here.\n\n\n\nFor writing, we collaborate using GoogleDocs. For code and analyses we encourage the use of version control (see Wilson et al. paper for what this could look like), stepping toward the use of git and github for sharing code and analyses. We believe there are many advantages of using these tools to help simplify workflows and shift cognitive load to the science being done rather than on organization and bookkeeping (which computers are good at). Recognizing that these tools represent a learning curve, we provide training in their use, and also encourage alternatives for sharing and documenting work. For example, code and analyses may also be shared among collaborators using a Google Drive folder.\n\n\n\nThe average life expectancy of a hard drive is less than the duration of most graduate programs. Thus it is critical to ensure your data and work are backed up regularly. You may have personal backup solutions (e.g. through Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) but the lab has dedicated storage space on a university server that is backed up in multiple locations. Your data should be backed up on here. For information on logging on and accessing this, see information provided on a GitHub issue\n\n\n\nWelcome to R! There are so many learning resources out there it can feel a little overwhelming in terms of what to choose! To get you set up and started, Happy Git and Github for the useR is a great resource, and is created by the same authors as the now-legendary stat545.com course. Their resources are extremely comprehensive and they have a fantastic Intro R course, especially for those who will be using R for doing statistics.\nRight now, we REALLY like this short intro course by @juliesquid & @allisonhorst. They teach a lot of the workflow and tools around using R right from the get go, which we think is more helpful than knowing how to do all the things. The (excellent) materials are thoughtfully put together, link to a ton of other great resources, and just like the online #rstats community in general, are super supportive of new learners.\nWe also really like:\n\nTeacup Giraffes R and statistics materials from Desirée De Leon and Hasse Walum.\n\nData Science in a Box course by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and\nAdventures in R by Kelly Bodwin.\n\nIf you want a book to work from/through, R for Data Science is highly recommended. (book is free online)\nThe R Studio Education team have assembled a phenomenal array of courses, tutorials, and other materials for learning R, and for many types of data analyses and modeling using R. These are top notch and so thoughtfully put together. There is something for learners at all levels.\nA plug for the online R community. Follow the hashtag #rstats, & also check out accounts @RLadiesGlobal & @R4dsCommunity. The weekly #TidyTuesday social coding project is also a great way to practice your growing R skills. Have fun!\nThe R4dsCommunity Slack is a briliant resource for getting help to your R questions and finding tutorials. They also hold online Office Hours where you can get help with R from a real human.\nThe RStudio Community is a great go-to.\nLearn R from within R with interactive sessions using swirlstats.com.\nThe carpentries R lessons are also a fab resource.\n\n\n\n[resources detail]"

The best thing a leader can do is to identify the needs of their team to support them in a way that allows them to thrive.\nHowever, Jason’s default style tends to be that of a servant leader. While he might adopt other leadership styles depending on the situation, servant leadership guides his daily leadership style.\nJason has been inspired by David Marquet’s story:\n\nas well as by Simon Sinek:"

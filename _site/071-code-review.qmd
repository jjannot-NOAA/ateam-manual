# Code Review


> TAKEN FROM [2024 ADP Team Charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1spu2uv0KmV2_aW64qwe2pJndPrSeHNEj1Utzi_lLpjU/edit) 
Coding and review
Steps before pushing to the Repository (git bash specific)
git checkout main (switches your local to your local main branch)
git pull origin main (pulls remote main and puts in your local)
git checkout [your dev branch] (switches to your dev branch]
git merge main (merges your local main to your local dev branch)
This is where if there are conflicts they will occur.
git log - - oneline (lists all the commits)
q (escape)
git remote -v (checks your connection)
git push origin [branch name]
Preparing pull request: In remote GitHub
Go to your branch and select new pull request
Assign a reviewer
Make comments
Select pull request.
Removing item from repo
On local, navigate to file, delete it, git status should show that file was deleted. 
git add -u     (stages all uncommitted changes)
git commit -m <commit message>     (commits the deletion)
Git log –online    (view commits made on the branch)
git checkout main; git pull origin main  (make sure local main is up to date with remote)
git checkout <your branch>; git merge main   (make sure your branch is up to date with your local main>
git push origin <your branch>    (push your changes to the remote)
Review on GitHub
Go to github, find your branch, and ‘open a pull request’. Can write a summary of what your changes are doing.
Assign a reviewer (we are ignoring ‘assignee’)
Reviewer gets an e-mail, they go to the remote on GitHub, find the pull request they are assigned, and reviews changes
Go to ‘files changed’ tab and can review code and add comments or open ‘reviews’, which are tasks that must be completed before the pull request can be merged.  Note- our free version of github does not enforce these rules and we need to be on the honor system for this. Once all review comments are made, complete an and submit the review (upper right button)
Once the developer adds comments or pushes changes that satisfy the review comments, the reviewer then changes their review status to ‘approved’ (again from the upper-right).
After review is complete and merge is made, you’ll get a button to delete the development branch from the remote repository. Do this so that our remote is clean!

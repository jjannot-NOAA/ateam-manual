We use Google Docs to set agendas, record decisions, and outline action items during these meetings.\nThe agenda is a single document – this makes finding and referencing old agenda items easier. At the end of each meeting, in prep for the next meeting, the table and agenda outline are copied to the top of the page, the date of the next meeting is added and any items or decisions that were covered and settled or meetings that have passed are removed to make space for the next meeting’s items.\nDuring the time between meetings, staff are expected to:\n\nfill in their updates in the table\n\nreview all the staff updates prior to the meeting and come with any questions\n\nif appropriate, add items to the Discussion, Parking Lot, Meetings or other sections of the agenda\n\nScrivener duties for the meeting rotate among A-Team staff and are listed at the bottom of the agenda. The Scrivener is responsible for setting up the page for the next meeting (see above), running the meeting, and documenting discussions and decisions.\n\n\n\n1:1 with Jason\nEach team member has individual in-person meetings with Jason.\nEach member is responsible for documenting their 1:1 meetings with Jason, including tracking decisions and action items for themselves.

Feedback can be either reinforcing, i.e., it reinforces behaviors or actions that lead to outcomes we want, or redirecting, i.e., it outlines behaviors or actions that lead to unwanted outcomes and provides alternative behaviors or actions that lead to desired outcomes.\nGiving and receiving redirecting feedback can be difficult. However, if we don’t get feedback, we can’t see our own blind-spots. If we don’t provide constructive ways for others to improve, then we can’t expect them to improve and we can’t expect to have our own needs met.\nHealthy, productive teams have members who give each other six (6) or more reinforcing feedback comments for every redirecting feedback comment.\nReward your colleagues for good work and deeds. Here’s some ways to recognize them.\nSimon Sinek has some great advice for how to give difficult feedback (watch at least to the 6:10 mark; but the whole clip is worthwhile).\nEffective communication skills are like muscles, we need to exercise them. You can’t go to the gym for 9 hours and expect to be in shape. But if you go for 30 minutes a day, every day, you will eventually get in shape. Similarly, the first time you try to give or receive feedback in a new way, it might go badly. But eventually it will get better and easier - but never easy.\nNot having a conversation because it will be hard is not an excuse for not having a conversation. Difficult conversations avoided today become tomorrow’s even more difficult conversation.\nThis resource from UBC outlines best practices for giving and receiving feedback.\nHow to Create a Culture of Feedback"

    "text": "Psychological Safety\n\nWhat is Psychological Safety?\nAll members of Analytical Services (including the Program Manager) are expected to conform to a set of behavioral norms that are designed to make the workplace a psychologically and physically safe space.\n\nA norm is a rule that guides behavior toward the usual, typical, and/or standard behavior of a group.\n\nA psychologically safe space is:\n\n“a climate in which people are comfortable expressing and being themselves.” – Amy Edmondson, The Fearless Organization\n\nIn practice, this means that people feel comfortable taking risks, being themselves, speaking their minds, and being openly vulnerable in front of co-workers. The ability to be vulnerable in a workplace is directly related to the consequences that individuals feel they might be subject to if they are openly vulnerable.\nIn a double-blind research study of teams, Google found that the most important feature of highly effective teams was the presence of psychological safety.\n\n\n\nWhy Do We Need Psychological Safety in the Workplace?\nEvidence shows that creating a psychologically safe workplace is strongly linked with highly effective teams1 which are more likely to share ideas, give and welcome feedback, experiment, and discuss mistakes openly1,2. Psychologically safe workplaces are linked to higher employee satisfaction2\n\nBoth images above are from Science for Work.\n\n\nHow Do We Create Psychological Safety in the Workplace?\nTo promote psychological safety, we can:\n\nDevelop self-awareness so that you can adjust your emotional responses and learn to react in a way that invites open discussion.\n\nDemonstrate concern for other team members as people so that they feel comfortable speaking up and showing up as their whole selves.\n\nAsk questions, show appreciation for other’s ideas, and suspend judgement.\n\nEngage in positive dialog to inspire honest conversations.\n\nOwn up to our mistakes and share learnings from failures.\n\n\nSee also the resources for Psychological Safety and Wellness"

Guidelines:\n\nCan carry up to 24 credit hours\n\nNo advance approval is needed\n\nProperly record credit hours on timesheet\n\nSubmit a Request for Premium Pay in GovTA\n\n\n\nCompensatory Time\nCompensatory time can be awarded for travel that occurs outside or beyond normal working hours or days (e.g., “red-eye” flight, travel on weekend, etc).\nCompensatory time for working (as opposed to traveling) is typically not awarded. Rather, overtime work is typically compensated via overtime pay or credit hours (see above).\nA quick guide for how to claim and record Compensatory Time for traveling can be found here."

They are a discussion point between coders. They can be used to:\n\nreview and discuss code: a new feature, improvements, strategy, etc.\naddress issues\nany time new code is added to the repo\n\nWhat are the benefits of pull requests as code review2?\n\nIncreases the quality of the code\nDecreases probability of breaking stuff\nFrees time from micromanaging other peoples code\nReduces the need for meetings\nEmail notifications act as the interface\nThey create a history - all discussion & code (even if it is ultimately rejected), lives on a branch\n\nThe downsides include (see also2):\n1. You have to wait to have your code reviewed by others\n2. Reviewer can get backed up & overwhelmed\n\n\nHow to Submit a Pull Request\n\nGo to the repo, at the top click on Pull Requests\n\nCreate a New Pull Request (green button upper right)\n\nEnsure you are comparing the right branches\n\nLook at the gitdiff\n\nGive it an appropriate succint title\n\nInclude a descriptive message\n\nWhat has been done\n\nHow to use the new code\n\nWhat someone could do to test the code, e.g., do…\n\n\nCreate the request\n\nAdd a reviewer - upper right hand corner. Will trigger an email.\n\nOnce reviewed, the pull request will be merged with the branch (typically main)\n\nNOTE: You can add more commits to a single pull request, provided it has not been reviewed and merged. However, only do this for very minor changes - missing spaces, typos, missing last lines etc.\n\n\nHow to Review a Pull Request\n\nOpen the pull request\n\nReview the code changes\n\nReviewer - provide comments and feedback as comments\n\nOriginator - respond to comments, perhaps add comments\n\nReviewer - Approve changes (upper right corner) and add approval comment\n\nReviewer - merge pull request\n\nOriginator - delete the branch once the code has been merged. Please do this so that our remote is clean!\n\nDONT FORGET TO PULL the new code to your local instance to get latest code."

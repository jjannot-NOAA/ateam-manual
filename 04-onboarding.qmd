Foreign Nationals should review the [AFSC Interal Foreign Nationals webpage](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/security/foreign-nationals) during their first few days of employment.

</p>

## CAC - Common Access Card
A CAC will give you access to buildings and computer systems.  It is the necessary first step to getting started.

Both **Federal and non-Federal employees** will need a CAC.    

Foreign Nationals (FN) **are not** assigned a CAC. FNs will need to obtain a [CAC Waiver](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/technology/it-security/cac-waivers). Work with your NOAA Sponsor.

### Get a New CAC
CAC cards are only issued at Defense Department authorized locations (referred to as "RAPIDS" offices) and may or may not be associated with a NOAA facility.  For AFSC staff, the following locations are the closet RAPIDS stations.  

1. Seattle staff = WRC building 1, site ID 105831 (phone: 206-526-6571)

2. Juneau staff = Federal Bldg, site 102444 (phone: 907-463-2170)

### Renew a CAC
 See the [CAC Renewal page](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/security/cac-renewal) on MyAFSC.
 
## IT
 On the first day, an A-Team member (likely Jason), will bring you to OFIS to:  
  
  * get computer equipment
  * set-up accounts (including an Oracle database account)
  * get logged into NOAA computer & Google account
  * [request a VPN account](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsites.google.com%2Fnoaa.gov%2Fmyafsc%2Ftechnology%2Fvpn-virtual-private-network&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1YGm7HPymJCqrAYQakwJVj)
  * download software needed (e.g., R, RStudio, SQL Developer, Endnote)
  * check the [IT Onboarding webpage](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/technology/onboarding-and-clearing-it) for more information    
  
#### Confidential Data
Data used by the Analytical Services Program in it's raw[^1] form is considered to contain confidential information.  As such, you will need to read and sign a Statement of Non-Disclosure (SON).  Work with the PM to get this completed in the early days of on-boarding.    

All confidential data must be summarized to meet the Rule of Three before being shared with anyone who does not have a current, signed SON on file with FMA.  The rule of three requires that, when data is aggregated, every data point in the aggregated data set includes a minimum of three entities which mask the confidential information in such a way that individual entities cannot be identified or tied to a specific data point.

More general information on confidential data can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/technology/it-security/privacy-impacts).

## Schedules, Time & Attendance
#### non-Federal employees
Guidance on schedules, time and attendance should be provided by your employer. Please also be sure to work with the A-Team Program Manager on setting your schedule.

#### Federal employees
If you are federal employee, you will access your timesheets through the [GovTA](https://docwebta.eas.commerce.gov/webta/) web portal. Within one week of on-boarding [Enterprise Services](https://enterpriseservices.servicenowservices.com/es) will create a new profile for you in GovTA.

You should:
  
* work with the Program Manager to set your work schedule    
* familiarize yourself with the defintions and rules around [Alternative Work Schedules](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VlxkCEHZEdQd2pfGu9Bud5QZDUudqioa/view?pli=1)    
* fill out an [Employee Work Schedule Form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SvyTE2M6lQ0dcX5w3b0f7CJNxU6zDFDy/view?usp=share_link)    
* fill out a [Telework Application Agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19oABvmjMgRX4az-9U1Ijgd3ux5BwmHQw/view)    
* fill out a [Telework Application Routing form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSchGHo2aulpw4md1jFiEAnAtQ9NS-idmG9gJ_ngqlB-MQj3_w/viewform)
* take the CLC Telework Training    

Forms and information can be found on the [myAFSC Time and Attendance page](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/time-and-attendance)

  [Time and Attendance Resources](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/time-and-attendance)

### Leave
#### non-Federal employees
Guidance on leave should be provided by your employer.

#### Federal employees
 Use GovTA to request leave.  You can find resources related to leave [here](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/time-and-attendance)

### Working Over-Time (more than 40/80)
#### non-Federal employees
Obtain guidance on over-time from your employer.

#### Federal employees
 For Federal staff, there are three mechanisms for being compensated for working more than 80 hours in a pay period (PP):
 
 * Overtime Pay
 * Credit hours for those on maxi-flex schedules
 * Compensatory time
 
##### Overtime Pay
 Overtime pay is awarded for working beyond the 80 hours in a pay period.  This should not occur often during the year. As best as possible, please work with the Program Manager ahead of time to gain approval for overtime work.
 If you are on a Maxi-Flex schedule, Credit Hours can be claimed *in lieu* of overtime pay. Guidelines:
 
 * Gain approval from Program Manager beforehand
 * Work with PM and Timekeeper to fill out paperwork
 
##### Credit Hours
 If you are on a Maxi-Flex schedule, Credit Hours can be claimed *in lieu* of overtime pay. Guidelines:
 
 * Can carry up to 24 credit hours    
 * No advance approval is needed    
 * Properly record credit hours on timesheet    
 * Submit a Request for Premium Pay in GovTA
 

##### Compensatory Time
Compensatory time can be awarded for **travel** that occurs outside or beyond normal working hours or days (e.g., "red-eye" flight, travel on weekend, etc).
 
 Compensatory time for working (as opposed to traveling) is typically not awarded.  Rather, overtime work is typically compensated via overtime pay or credit hours (see above).
 
  A quick guide for how to claim and record Compensatory Time for traveling can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdvL0mbBE0JY5HkDjdoi5RhCc0rn3G0SfXFHeo03nzY/edit).

## Duties {#duties}
Both Federal and non-Federal employees will work with the PM to determine specific responsibilities, individual projects, deliverables, and duties. Duties and responsibilities will be revisited (with the PM, and when appropriate, members of the A-Team) during the year and updated to reflect any changes on a regular basis.

Duties that team members might assume, depending on interest, time, Program/Division/Center priorities, and needs include (but are not limited to):

* leading and assisting in designated research projects
* participation in professional development opportunities
* presenting analyses and results to NPFMC and other stakeholders    
* developing and submitting research funding proposals
* submitting and publishing NOAA Technical Memorandum and other reports
* submitting and publishing peer-reviewed journal articles
* participating in outreach activities
* attending scientific and professional conferences

## Performance {#sec-perf}
#### non-Federal employees
Guidance on performance reviews should be provided by your employer.

#### Federal employees
Soon after joining the A-Team, you should work with the PM to create an annual, individual [Performance Plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18veCUTjncQVhRY6jOou9kclKWXJssOca/view?pli=1).  Specific responsibilities, individual projects, deliverables, and duties will be reflected in the individual Performance Plan. This document will guide your work and will be revisited (in discussions with the PM) during the year and updated to reflect any changes on an annual basis.    

Duties that team members might assume, depending on interest, time, Program/Division/Center priorities, and needs are listed above under [Duties](#duties).

More about the performance process can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/inside-fisheries-hc/human-capital/performance-culture-incentive-and-honorary-awards/commerce-alternative-personnel-system-caps).

The [AFSC Awards page](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/workforce-management/awards) lists the many ways Federal employees can be recognized and awarded for their achievements including opportunities to nominate your peers for their hard work.

The [New Employee Onboarding](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aZcoJooHxNMh4kjCiv4WUgpDtszub1PI) Google Drive folder has many good resources.

## CAC
A CAC will give you access to buildings and computer systems.  It is the necessary first step to getting started.

### Get a New CAC
CAC cards are only issued at Defense Department authorized locations (referred to as "RAPIDS" offices) and may or may not be associated with a NOAA facility.  For AFSC staff, the following locations are the closet RAPIDS stations.  

1. Seattle staff = WRC building 1, site ID 105831 (phone: 206-526-6571)

2. Juneau staff = Federal Bldg, site 102444 (phone: 907-463-2170)

### Renew a CAC
 See the [CAC Renewal page](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/security/cac-renewal) on MyAFSC
 
## IT
 On the first day, an A-Team member (likely Jason), will bring you to OFIS to:  
  
  * get computer equipment
  * set-up accounts (including an Oracle database account)
  * get logged into NOAA computer & Google account
  * request VPN accounts
  * download software needed (e.g., R, RStudio, SQL Developer, Endnote)
  * check the [IT Onboarding webpage](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/technology/onboarding-and-clearing-it) for more information

  [IT Help](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/technology/afsc-it-service-desk)
  
## Schedules, Time & Attendance
You will access your timesheets through the [GovTA](https://docwebta.eas.commerce.gov/webta/) web portal. Within one week of on-boarding [Enterprise Services](https://enterpriseservices.servicenowservices.com/es) will create a new profile for you in webTA/GovTA.

You should:
  
* work with Jason to set your work schedule
* fill out an [Employee Work Schedule Form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SvyTE2M6lQ0dcX5w3b0f7CJNxU6zDFDy/view?usp=share_link)    
* fill out a [Telework Application Agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19oABvmjMgRX4az-9U1Ijgd3ux5BwmHQw/view)    
* fill out a Telework Application Routing form
* take the CLC Telework Training
    
Forms and information can be found on the [myAFSC Time and Attendance page](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/time-and-attendance)

  [Time and Attendance Resouces](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/time-and-attendance)

### Leave
 Use GovTA to request leave.  You can find resources related to leave [here](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/time-and-attendance)

### Compensatory Time
 In most cases, compensatory time can be awarded for travel that occurs outside or beyond normal working hours or days.
 
 Compensatory time for working (as opposed to traveling) is typically not awarded.  Rather, overtime work is typically compensated via overtime pay.
 
  A quick guide for how to claim and record Compensatory Time can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdvL0mbBE0JY5HkDjdoi5RhCc0rn3G0SfXFHeo03nzY/edit).
  
## Performance {#sec-perf}

Soon after joining the A-Team, you should work with the PM to create an annual, individual [Performance Plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18veCUTjncQVhRY6jOou9kclKWXJssOca/view?pli=1).  This document will guide your work and will be revisited (in discussions with the PM) during the year and updated to reflect any changes on an annual basis.  The exact set of responsibilities, projects, deliverables, and duties will be clearly defined agreed on in your Performance Plan.

More about the performance process can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/inside-fisheries-hc/human-capital/performance-culture-incentive-and-honorary-awards/commerce-alternative-personnel-system-caps).

The [AFSC Awards page](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/workforce-management/awards) lists the many ways you can be recognized and awarded for your achievements as well as opportunities to nominate your peers for their hard work.

### Transit Benefits for Bicyclists
Allows for reimbursement to employees who use a non-motorized bicycle for a substantial portion of travel between your residence and the worksite. Reimbursement can be up to $20 per month, not to exceed $240 per calendar year for bicycle commuting expenses.

[More information on bike benefits and instructions](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/cao/about-ocao/logistics-operations-division/noaa-transit-subsidy-program).

### Transportation Subsidy
NOAA offers this non-taxable transit-fare subsidy program to encourage federal employees to use public mass transportation while commuting to and from work.  Qualified employees are provided with a monthly benefit based on the distance to and from work. The monthly maximum subsidy transit benefit allowance is $270. Unused benefits do not carry over to the next month.  

[More information on the transit subsidy program and application.](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/cao/about-ocao/logistics-operations-division/noaa-transit-subsidy-program)

## AFSC Contact Card
  You are encouraged to set-up an AFSC Contact Card, for example, see [Jason's Contact Card](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/contact/jason-e-jannot).  This is optional and not required but provides a public facing profile so that others within and outside NOAA can find you and can be linked to other social media accounts (e.g., Research Gate, LinkedIn, etc.). You can request a [Contact Card here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDfxoDycZjcmXDfPY_KnHwb2vPQ8HTzfFCSVt-qOvq_xPIZw/viewform)

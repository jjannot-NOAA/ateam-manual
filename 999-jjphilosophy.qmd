# Jason Jannot's Leadership Philosophy {#sec-jj-philosophy}

Jason's philosophy is that the best leaders are capable of adjusting their leadership style depending on the situation, their team, and the needs of particular projects. The best thing a leader can do is to identify the needs of their team to support them in a way that allows them to thrive.

However, Jason's default style tends to be that of a [servant leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership). While he might adopt other leadership styles depending on the situation, servant leadership guides his daily leadership style.

Jason has been  inspired by David Marquet's story:

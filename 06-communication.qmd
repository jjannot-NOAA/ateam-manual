# Communication {#communication}![](_img/communication_icon.png){height=70px}

There is a plethora of communication methods and technologies.  However, the communication tool should be chosen based on the purpose of the communication.  The purpose of this document is to explain how communication tools differ so that the tool used is appropriate given the topic(s) and timelines. 

## Email  ![](_img/email_icon.png){height=30px}

**Topics**: Single topics requiring little/no context, explanation, or discussion    
**Time**:    

  * Immediate action is not required and/or;    
  * Discussion is very limited or unnecessary and/or;    
  * Completion time is not pressing    

**Tone**: It can be very difficult to get the right tone in an email. Sometimes itâ€™s worthwhile to write the email but delay sending it. Then go back and check the tone after taking a pause.    
**Pros**: Creates a record    
**Cons**: Can be slow, lost, ignored    
**Tracking**: Formally captured in writing - creates a record    
**Uses**:    

  * Simple requests for a single action or, at most, a few closely related actions    
  * Short summary of a single topic    
  * Routine tasking    
  * Follow-up summaries from video calls/FTF/phone calls    

**Consider**: moving to a video call/FTF or phone call if the email chain goes back and forth more than a few times or in-depth discussion is necessary.

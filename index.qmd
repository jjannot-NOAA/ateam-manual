# Welcome![^1]


<br> This is the manual for the Analytical Services Team in the Fisheries Monitoring and Analysis Division at NOAA's Alaska Fisheries Science Center[^2].</br>

The focus of our work centers on providing scientific products to support the management of marine commercial fisheries.

This manual resource is intended to provide an overview for A-Team members and others about how we do our work, and our expectations for our team. It is also a space to document institutional knowledge and for important information about procedures and available resources. If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please contact Jason (jason.jannot\@noaa.gov) or make a pull request.

[^2]:Jeepers! That's a lot.  Let's just abbreviate from now on - you can find the definitions of abbreviations [here](11-acronyms.qmd#sec-acronyms)

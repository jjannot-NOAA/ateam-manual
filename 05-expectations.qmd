## Professional Behavior
All FMA Analytical Services staff (including the PM) are expected to adhere to the code of conduct and norms of behavior listed in [Chapter 4 Code of Conduct](03-code-of-conduct.qmd#code-of-conduct) of this manual.  See also the resources for [Psychological Safety](09-resources.qmd#psych-safety).


## Availability
* Core hours for the AFSC are 9:30 am to 2:30 pm, T,W,R.    
* A-Team members are encouraged to work in the office on one or more of these days.

* NOAA Telework Policy for Federal employees requires 2 days in the office per week.    
* Non-Federal employees should follow the telework guidance from their employer.

You are **not** expected to be available 24/7. Similarly, unless it is an emergency, do not expect responses to emails or any communication before or after regular business hours on weekdays (6 am - 6 pm), or any time on weekends/holidays/flex-days. However, because we recognize that A-Team members should be able to create a working schedule that is right for them, team members will not be penalized for sending communication outside normal working hours.

## Google
### G-Mail
We communicate largely via email on the A-Team. You should therefore check your email at least once a day during the normal work week. 

### G-Calendar
Much of our work is communicating and much of that communication comes in the form of meetings. Therefore, you should:    

* [Make your calendar visible](999-make-calendar-visible.qmd#sec-calendar) to others.    
* Keep your calendar up-to-date    
* Add your working location and hours    
* Add leave and out of office (OOO)    
* Set-up automated OOO messages with alternative contacts, if OOO for longer than 1 day

## Expectations of the Program Manager

As of `r format(Sys.Date(), "%Y")`, Jason Jannot is the FMA Analytical Program Manager.  You can read about his [leadership and management philosophy here](999-jjphilosophy.qmd#sec-jj-philosophy).

The Program Manager will (at a minimum) provide the A-Team with:  

* Clarity (the `why?`)
* Guidance (the `how?`)    
* Expectations (the `what?`)   
* Collaboration & Communication (the `who?`)
* Prioritization & Gate-keeping  
* Accountability    
* Visibility & Public Recognition    
* Overcoming Barriers    
* Timely Administrative Support

In addition to the above, the Program Manager will (at a minimum) provide individual team members with:  

* Positive feedback & constructive criticism on work  
* Professional career support and development, including but not limited to:    
    * opportunities for    
        * training    
        * presenting (e.g., conferences, meetings, outreach, etc.)    
        * publishing
        * advancing (e.g., promotion, details, etc.)    
        * collaborating    
        * leading    
        * mentoring
* Regular meetings to discuss work & maintain progress on goals

##  Expectations of Team Members

A-Team members will (at minimum): 

* strive to produce the best science, given the constraints    
* grow and maintain technical and inter-personal skills
* share knowledge, experience, code, and time    
* adopt a [service mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0mzqUMAc20)
* adopt a [collaborative working mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMG8ObDmbaM)    
* adapt and be flexible, within reason    
* communicate clearly and effectively
* communicate both successes and sticking points regularly    
* contribute to creating a positive, inclusive, and safe work culture

Remember, as a government agency, we serve the people of the United States and *service* is 1/3^rd^ of [NOAA's mission](https://www.noaa.gov/our-mission-and-vision). Adopting a service mindset when approaching each other, stakeholders, partners, and collaborators will magnify our positive impacts on marine ecosystems, commercial fishing, and the wider world.

Some ways to adopt a service mindset:    

* Share - [code](071-collaborate.qmd), knowledge, resources, opportunities 
* Serve as a role model    
* Serve as a resource for other members of the A-Team    
* Nominate your peers for their hard work and achievements - [AFSC Awards page](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/workforce-management/awards).
* Participate in outreach activities
* Mentor others when appropriate, especially new team members 

## Team Collaboration and Communication

Although the Program Manager is your primary supervisor, everyone should always feel like they can reach out to anyone else on the A-team for help or collaboration.

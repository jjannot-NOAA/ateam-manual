[Team culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlH0GgVbhwM) is a set of values, goals and attitudes that members of the same team practice to create a productive and healthy workplace atmosphere. It represents all the ways people behave and the attitudes and beliefs that inform those behaviors, including both the formal stated norms as well as the implicit ways people interact.      

The culture is [everyone's responsibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MEocQzw-54).

### Benefits of a Strong Culture

1. A more enjoyable work environment    
2. Greater engagement in the work    
3. Conflict is managed in a healthy manner    
4. Contributions are celebrated and valued    
5. Inspires leadership - even among those who have no formal supervisory duties    
6. Attracts and retains the best talent

[Trust is the foundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5qQJhe7sLE) for a strong culture. 

[Hyper-competitiveness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtpOYxsZj7o) can be destructive to individuals and to a strong culture.


## Values & Culture
![](_img/values.jpg){height=300, align='center'}
## NOTE: This section will be completed with input from all Analytical Services Program members during the Analytical Services Program Meeting early 2024.

### Our Principles
#### Service
[NOAA's Mission](https://www.noaa.gov/our-mission-and-vision) statement is science, **service**, and stewardship.  We are the Analytical **Services** Program. Therefore, we should strive to build a culture around service and adopt a service mindset by asking "How can I help?".    

**Service** in practice...    
* puts the needs of others first    
* actively listens    
* asks questions    
* suspends judgement    
* is [empathetic](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-be-empathetic)    
* helps resolve issues and challenges    
* exhibits [self-awareness](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/self-awareness-in-leadership)    
* shares time, knowlegdge, expertise, and energy

Even when the person being asked doesn't feel they need help,    
**asking `How can I help?` has multiple benefits** including:

1. Making others feel supported    
2. Reinforces the service mindset    
3. Builds communication skills    
4. Leads to broader opportunities for learning and growth    
5. Produces better results    
6. More positive about those you work with    

#### Stewardship
[NOAA's Mission](https://www.noaa.gov/our-mission-and-vision) statement also includes **stewardship**.

Stewardship encompasses how we handle the responsibilities entrusted to us.  These responsibilities include, but are not limited to the responsibility to:    
* our stakeholders    
* our work, outputs, effort, and projects    
* each other    
* ourselves

**Stewardship** in practice...    
* builds upon the resources and investments that are in our charge    
* takes calculated risks to improve processes and outcomes    
* learns from past mistakes    
* leads by example    
* is dependable and ethical    
* is committed to personal and professional growth    
* works to protect assets (e.g., economic opportunity, environment)

Good stewardship leads to...    
* positive impacts on processes and outcomes    
* maximizes the impact given the constraints (e.g., time, money, know-how)    
* growth of individuals and team members    
* protects assets from risks and hazards

<!-- <!-- ![](_img/visionicon.png){height=50, align= 'center'} -->

<!-- Success for the Analytical Services Program will be gauged by how we are perceived by others. Success will be if others look to our Program for inspiration and collaboration.  -->

<!-- * What does success look like for the team? -->
<!-- * What is the future state of the team? What does it look like? -->
<!-- * Answers the question: Where are you going? -->
<!-- * If there were no constraints at all, what would things look like in 5 years, 10 years, 20 years? -->
<!-- * What picture do we want to create for the future? -->
<!-- * What legacy do we want to leave behind? -->

## ![](_img/purpose_icon.png){height=100}Purpose - Why do we do this?

We firmly believe that economically and environmentally sustainable fisheries management:

* Must rely on data collected directly from commercial fishing vessels    
* The highest quality data is collected by scientific observers placed on commercial fishing vessels at sea or at shoreside processing plants    
* Both shoreside landing receipts and electronic monitoring do, and will continue to, play an important supporting role in providing data for fisheries management

We are committed to: 

* Using all commercial fishing data sources, in combination with each other or other environmental or economic data when appropriate, to produce the best available science    
* Developing high-quality science for use in fisheries management and to advance the fields of fisheries science and management    
* Disseminating and communicating the best science based on these data    
* Sharing our data, knowledge, and advice to the greatest extent possible    
* Developing, enhancing, and fostering positive and strong collaborations among ourselves and our [stakeholders](the-big-picture.qmd#subsec-stakeholders)

* What is the inspiration that guides and motivates the team to achieve the mission?

## ![](_img/mission_icon.png){height=50}Mission - What do we do?

Our mission is to provide the highest quality best available science for use in managing fisheries and marine resources.

The FMA Analytical Services Program adheres to NOAA's mission of [Science, Service, and Stewardship](https://www.noaa.gov/our-mission-and-vision).

Science^[Scientific products might include (but is not limited to) data, data products, software, web applications, summaries, reports, analyses, models, presentations and advice.  
] from the FMA A-Team:

- is rigorous, quantitative, and best available;
- based on statistics and evidence and;
- aims for transparency & reproducibility.

Service from the FMA A-Team:

- is to provide the best-available science for use in decision-making;
- based on clear, consistent and effective communication and collaboration;
- aims to share data, knowledge, and information

Stewardship from the FMA A-Team:

- is to protect living marine resources, commercial fisheries, and the people who work in, on, or with marine ecosystems;
- based on the diverse skill set and evolving abilities of the people and leveraged technologies and;
- aims to be rational, ethical, and equitable.

# Code of Conduct \hspace{1cm} {#sec-code-of-conduct}![](_img/Code_Conduct_icon.png){height=40px}

A **Code of Conduct** is a set of basic ground rules that we ask team members to follow. The goal is to create an open and inclusive space for our work that helps us achieve our collective goals. Along with our  [Big Picture](02-the-big-picture.qmd#sec-big_picture), the **Code of Conduct**

  * provides a benchmark for self-evaluation
  * helps define our identity
  * establishes behavioral guidelines

**We expect all team members to adhere to the policies and guidelines outlined here, as well as those found in the [AFSC Code of Conduct](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wV0g2Tea0jdPjsTeNNST7I871j70qLAw/view).**  

***The FMA Analytical Services Program is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of team members or others in our larger communities in any form.***

This code of conduct applies to all A-Team spaces, including group and individual meetings (face to face and remote), workshops, email correspondence, chat and web channels, and code repositories. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned and referred to the AFSC's policies.

## Managing Conflict

To promote healthy resolutions to conflict, build trust, and develop a sense of psychological safety on th A-Team, **all members of the Analytical Services Program are expected to:**

1. Delay entering into conversations when feelings are "elevated" (i.e., high level of frustration, anger, upset, etc.)    

    * Why? [Anger impacts the way you process infomation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_5DU5opOFk).  Other emotions can have [negative impacts on communication](https://nulab.com/learn/collaboration/overcoming-emotional-barriers-to-communication/) as well.    
    * What to do    
      * If you are angry, do not confront the person until you are able to have a rational conversation where you [open to hearing them and can actively listen](https://welldoing.org/article/how-communicate-when-youre-angry).    
      * If you are confronted by a person who is angry or upset

3. Recognize the humanity in yourself and others. This means:    

    * Recognizing that no one is perfect, we all make mistakes.    
    * Gracefully and sincerely apologizing when mistakes are made.

## Psychological Safety

### What is Psychological Safety?

All members of Analytical Services (including the Program Manager) are expected to conform to a set of behavioral norms that are designed to make the workplace a psychologically and physically safe space.

> A **norm** is a rule that guides behavior toward the usual, typical, and/or standard behavior of a group.

A psychologically safe space is:

> “a climate in which people are comfortable expressing and being themselves.” -- Amy Edmondson, *The Fearless Organization*

In practice, this means that people feel comfortable taking risks, being themselves, speaking their minds, and being openly vulnerable in front of co-workers.  The ability to be vulnerable in a workplace is directly related to the consequences that individuals feel they might be subject to if they are openly vulnerable.

In a double-blind research study of teams, [Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/introduction/) found that the most important feature of highly effective teams was the presence of [psychological safety](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/identify-dynamics-of-effective-teams/).

### Why Do We Need Psychological Safety in the Workplace?

Evidence shows that creating a psychologically safe workplace is strongly linked with highly effective teams[^1] which are more likely to share ideas, give and welcome feedback, experiment, and discuss mistakes openly^1,^[^2]. Psychologically safe workplaces are linked to higher employee satisfaction^2^

### How Do We Create Psychological Safety in the Workplace?

To promote psychological safety, we can:

1. Develop self-awareness so that you can adjust your emotional responses and learn to react in a way that invites open discussion.    
2. Demonstrate concern for other team members as people so that they feel comfortable speaking up and showing up as their whole selves.    
3. Ask questions, show appreciation for other's ideas, and suspend judgement.    
4. Engage in positive dialog to inspire honest conversations.    
5. Own up to our mistakes and share learnings from failures.

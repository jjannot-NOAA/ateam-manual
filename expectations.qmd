## NOAA Fisheries CORE Policies
Most of NOAA Fisheries policies can be found in the [CORE Policy Handbook](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/inside-fisheries-core/table-of-contents)

Many other NOAA Fisheries employee resources can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/inside-fisheries/home)

## Professional Behavior
All FMA Analytical Services staff (including the PM) are expected to adhere to the code of conduct and norms of behavior listed in [Chapter 4 Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.qmd#sec-code-of-conduct) of this manual.    

It’s important for all of us within the Program to *always, always* show respect and courtesy to others in all of our professional communications and interactions – that includes face-to-face, virtual meetings, emails, phone calls, chat, and text. It also includes all interactions among Program staff or any professional interactions outside the Program.    

**As a service Program our most important asset is our relationships!**    

Professional behavior includes, but is not limited to:    

1. Always using an appropriate tone and volume when speaking. Yelling is almost never necessary, unless there is an emergency or someone is in immediate danger.    
2. Always using appropriate body language to help emphasize our point.  When words and body language send different messages, humans defer to *the message in the body language*. This means that intimidating body language such as leaning across a desk, getting into someone face, standing up, looming over a person, or beating our chest are all inappropriate behaviors in the workplace. They are counterproductive to getting your message across.    
3. Always using appropriate language – that means no swearing, no inappropriate or derogatory descriptions of others such as “ignorant”, “idiot”, “stupid”. These create a toxic work environment and they are unnecessary and counterproductive.    
4. Always work to support each other, not to undermine others. This means we do not "talk trash" or disparage others under any circumstances.

### G-Mail
We communicate largely via email on the A-Team. You should therefore check your email at least once a day during the normal work week. 

### G-Calendar

* [Make your calendar visible](make-calendar-visible.qmd#sec-calendar) to others.    
* Keep your calendar up-to-date    
* Add your working location and hours

* Set-up automated OOO message, if OOO for longer than 1 day

### Tardiness & Absence 
Let's face it - life happens.  Be kind.  If you're going to be late, please notify someone else in the meeting as soon as you realize it and provide a time frame for arrival.  If you know in advance that you aren't going to attedn the meeting, decline on your calendar. 

## Expectations of the Program Manager

As of `r format(Sys.Date(), "%Y")`, Jason Jannot is the FMA Analytical Program Manager.  You can read about his [leadership and management philosophy here](jjphilosophy.qmd#sec-jj-philosophy).

The Program Manager will (at a minimum) provide the A-Team with:  

* Clarity (the `why?`)    
* Guidance (the `how?`)    
* Expectations (the `what?`)    
* Collaboration & Communication (the `who?`)    
* Prioritization & Gate-keeping    
* Accountability    
* Visibility & Public Recognition    
* Support Overcoming Barriers    
* Timely Administrative Support    
* A Professional and Ethical Role Model


In addition to the above, the Program Manager will (at a minimum) provide individual team members with:  

* Positive feedback & constructive criticism on work  
* Professional career support and development, including but not limited to:    
    * opportunities for    
        * training    
        * presenting (e.g., conferences, meetings, outreach, etc.)    
        * publishing
        * advancing (e.g., promotion, details, etc.)

        * leading    
        * mentoring
* Regular meetings to discuss work & maintain progress on goals

##  Expectations of Team Members

A-Team members will (at minimum): 

* behave professionally and ethically in all work interactions
* strive to produce the best science, given the constraints    
* grow and maintain technical and inter-personal skills
* share knowledge, experience, code, and time    
* adopt a [service mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0mzqUMAc20)
* adopt a [collaborative working mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMG8ObDmbaM)    
* adapt and be flexible, within reason    
* communicate clearly and effectively
* communicate both successes and sticking points regularly    
* contribute to creating a positive, inclusive, and safe work culture

Remember, as a government agency, we serve the people of the United States and *service* is 1/3^rd^ of [NOAA's mission](https://www.noaa.gov/our-mission-and-vision). Adopting a service mindset when approaching each other, stakeholders, partners, and collaborators will magnify our positive impacts on marine ecosystems, commercial fishing, and the wider world.

Some ways to adopt a service mindset:    

* Share - [code](collaborate.qmd), knowledge, resources, opportunities 
* Serve as a role model    
* Serve as a resource for other members of the A-Team    
* Nominate your peers for their hard work and achievements - [AFSC Awards page](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/workforce-management/awards).
* Participate in outreach activities
* Mentor others when appropriate, especially new team members 

## Team Collaboration and Communication

Although the Program Manager is your primary supervisor, everyone should always feel like they can reach out to anyone else on the A-team for help or collaboration.

# Introduction {#intro}

The FMA Analytical Services Program adheres to NOAA's mission of [Science, Service, and Stewardship](https://www.noaa.gov/our-mission-and-vision).

Background on the history, science, and management of Alaska fisheries and the North Pacific Observer Program can be found in [Appendix A - Alaska Fisheries Background](999-fishery-background.qmd)

In short, the mission of the Analytical Services Program is to use fishery-dependent data collected by the FMA, in conjunction with other data sources collected by various agencies, to create scientific products that inform fisheries management and science.
<!-- Modify based on Program Launch additions to 02-the-big-picture.qmd#sec-big-picture -->

[The Big Picture](02-the-big-picture.qmd#sec-big_picture) describes our culture and philosophy in more detail.

The FMA Analytical Services Program was a team for many years prior to becoming a fully-fledged program in May 2023. Internally, we informally refer to ourselves as the A-Team.

## How we meet

### A-Team Meetings {#ateam-meetings}
#### semimonthly Thursdays, 1000 PT, Google Meet
Currently, as a whole team, we meet virtually by Google Meet every 2 weeks. We use Google Docs to set agendas, record decisions, and outline action items during these meetings.

The [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WvOqt77kHU4_72IQFUuYN3M9kF2xTi56QtwpRFHf6C4/edit#heading=h.32mfp9s1k5bh) is a single document -- this makes finding and referencing old agenda items easier.  At the end of each meeting, in prep for the next meeting, the table and agenda outline are copied to the top of the page, the date of the next meeting is added and any items or decisions that were covered and settled or meetings that have passed are removed to make space for the next meeting's items.  

During the time between meetings, staff are expected to:    

* fill in their updates in the table    
* review all the staff updates prior to the meeting and come with any questions    
* if appropriate, add items to the Discussion, Parking Lot, Meetings or other sections of the agenda    

[Scrivener](https://www.wordnik.com/words/scrivener) duties for the meeting rotate among A-Team staff and are listed at the bottom of the agenda.  The Scrivener is responsible for setting up the page for the next meeting (see above), running the meeting, and documenting discussions and decisions. 

### 1:1 with Jason {#meet-with-Jason}
Each team member has individual in-person meetings with Jason.    
Each  member is responsible for documenting their 1:1 meetings with Jason, including tracking decisions and action items for themselves. Jason is happy to collaborate in Google Docs with individuals if that is their desire.

## How we give and receive feedback

Feedback, both giving and receiving it, is an important aspect of our team. We expect feedback to be supportive but constructive. Feedback we give and receive can come in a variety of places and times, including but not limited to, during:   

  * brainstorming sessions   
  * meetings   
  * reviews of code or written documents   
  * practice talks   
  * post-project/post-meeting debriefs   
  * 1:1's  

See the Feedback section of the [Code of Conduct](#03-code-of-conduct.qmd) for more discussion and some resources.

## How we share things

**Ask for help, and share what you learn and know:** Most of our learning is done from each other. Struggling through problems alone is inefficient. Ask for and give assistance with awareness of the value of everyone's time.

We think it is useful to have standard ways of sharing things. These don't always have to be followed but are a useful guide. The most important principle is to make it easier for others and your future self!    

* Mechanisms for Sharing
  * Code: Github, Google Docs    
    * GitHub account: [Alaska Fisheries Monitoring Analytics](https://github.com/Alaska-Fisheries-Monitoring-Analytics)    
  * Docs: Rmarkdown, Google Docs, or MSWord    
    * [A-team Manual](https://github.com/Alaska-Fisheries-Monitoring-Analytics/ateam-manual)    
  * Network Drives    
    * `Y://Programs Share/FMA_Observers/Observer/A is for ANALYSIS/`    
    * Google Drive: `FMA Analysis Group` <font size="1.5"> (request access) </font>    
  * FMAnalytics G-Chat Space    
  * project specific G-Chat Spaces (e.g., SASH, ADP)    
  * Github Issues    
* When sharing make sure to describe what you are sharing    
* A project-based approach to organizing your work makes it easier to share and solicit feedback from others    
  * here is a [good guide](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/08/structuring-r-projects/)

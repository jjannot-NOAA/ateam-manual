## How we meet

### A-Team Meetings
#### semimonthly Thursdays, 1000 PT, Google Meet
Currently, as a whole team, we meet virtually by Google Meet every 2 weeks. We use Google Docs to set agendas, record decisions made, and outline action items during these meetings. 

### 1:1 with Jason
We each have individual in-person meetings with Jason.    
Each  member is responsible for documenting their 1:1 meetings with Jason, including tracking decisions and action items for themselves. Jason is happy to collaborate in Google Docs with individuals if that is their desire.

## How we give feedback

Feedback, both giving and receiving it, is an important aspect of our team. We expect feedback to be supportive but constructive. Feedback we give and receive can come in a variety of places and times, including but not limited to, during: brainstorming sessions; meetings; reviews of code or written documents; practice talks; post-project/post-meeting debriefs; 1:1's with Jason. 

This [resource from UBC](https://scwrl.ubc.ca/stem-writing-resources/learning-strategies-for-communicating-science/how-to-give-and-receive-effective-feedback/) outlines best practices for giving and receiving feedback.

## How we share things

We think it is useful to have standard ways of sharing things. These don't always have to be followed but are a useful guide. The most important principle is to make it easier for others and your future self!    

* Mechanisms for Sharing
  * Code: Github (preferred), Google Docs    
    * GitHub account: [Alaska Fisheries Monitoring Analytics](https://github.com/Alaska-Fisheries-Monitoring-Analytics)    
  * Docs: Rmarkdown (preferred), Google Docs, or MSWord    
    * [A-team Manual](https://github.com/Alaska-Fisheries-Monitoring-Analytics/ateam-manual)    
  * Network Drives    
    * `Y://Programs Share/FMA_Observers/Observer/A is for ANALYSIS/`    
    * Google Drive: `FMA Analysis Group` <font size="1.5"> (request access) </font>
  * FMAnalytics G-Chat Space    
  * project specific G-Chat Spaces (e.g., SASH, ADP)    
  * Github Issues    
* When sharing make sure to describe what you are sharing    
* A project-based approach to organizing your work makes it easier to share and solicit feedback from others    
  * here is a [good guide](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/08/structuring-r-projects/)    
  * see also *Good enough practices in scientific computing* [@wilson2017])

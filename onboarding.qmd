Foreign Nationals should review the [AFSC Interal Foreign Nationals webpage](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/security/foreign-nationals) during their first few days of employment.

## CAC - Common Access Card
A CAC will give you access to buildings and computer systems.  It is the necessary first step to getting started.

Both **Federal and non-Federal employees** will need a CAC.    

Foreign Nationals (FN) **are not** assigned a CAC. FNs will need to obtain a [CAC Waiver](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/technology/it-security/cac-waivers). Work with your NOAA Sponsor.

### Get a New CAC
CAC cards are only issued at Defense Department authorized locations (referred to as "RAPIDS" offices) and may or may not be associated with a NOAA facility.  For AFSC staff, the following locations are the closet RAPIDS stations.  

1. Seattle staff = WRC building 1, site ID 105831 (phone: 206-526-6571)

2. Juneau staff = Federal Bldg, site 102444 (phone: 907-463-2170)

### Renew a CAC
 See the [CAC Renewal page](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/security/cac-renewal) on MyAFSC.
 
## IT
 On the first day, an A-Team member (likely Jason), will bring you to OFIS to:  
  
  * get computer equipment
  * set-up accounts (including an Oracle database account)
  * get logged into NOAA computer & Google account
  * [request a VPN account](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsites.google.com%2Fnoaa.gov%2Fmyafsc%2Ftechnology%2Fvpn-virtual-private-network&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1YGm7HPymJCqrAYQakwJVj)
  * download software needed (e.g., R, RStudio, SQL Developer, Endnote)
  
#### Confidential Data
Data used by the Analytical Services Program in it's raw^[Raw here could mean the data has gone through QAQC processes as well as other processing. However, the data has **not** been summarized to meet the rule of three.] form is considered to contain confidential information.  As such, you will need to read and sign a Statement of Non-Disclosure (SON).  Work with the PM to get this completed in the early days of on-boarding.    

All confidential data must be summarized to meet the Rule of Three before being shared with anyone who does not have a current, signed SON on file with FMA.  The rule of three requires that, when data is aggregated, every data point in the aggregated data set includes a minimum of three entities which mask the confidential information in such a way that individual entities cannot be identified or tied to a specific data point.

More general information on confidential data can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/technology/it-security/privacy-impacts).

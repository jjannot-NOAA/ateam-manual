It also includes all interactions among Program staff or any professional interactions outside the Program.    \n\n**As a service Program our most important asset is our relationships!**    \n\nProfessional behavior includes, but is not limited to:    \n\n1. Always using an appropriate tone and volume when speaking. Yelling is almost never necessary, unless there is an emergency or someone is in immediate danger.    \n2. Always using appropriate body language to help emphasize our point.  When words and body language send different messages, humans defer to *the message in the body language*. This means that intimidating body language such as leaning across a desk, getting into someone face, standing up, looming over a person, or beating our chest are all inappropriate behaviors in the workplace. They are counterproductive to getting your message across.    \n3. Always using appropriate language – that means no swearing, no inappropriate or derogatory descriptions of others such as “ignorant”, “idiot”, “stupid”. These create a toxic work environment and they are unnecessary and counterproductive.    \n4. Always work to support each other, not to undermine others. This means we do not \"talk trash\" or disparage others under any circumstances.\n\nSee also the resources for [Psychological Safety](psychological-safety-resources.qmd#psych-safety) and [Wellness](wellness-resources.qmd).\n\n\n## Availability\n* Core hours for the AFSC are 9:30 am to 2:30 pm, T,W,Th.    \n* A-Team members are encouraged to work in the office on one or more of these days.    \n* Core hours do not apply on Monday or Friday.    \n* NOAA Telework Policy for Federal employees requires 2 days in the office per pay period.    \n* Non-Federal employees should follow the telework guidance from their employer.\n\nYou are **not** expected to be available 24/7. Similarly, unless it is an emergency, do not expect responses to emails or any communication before or after regular business hours on weekdays (6 am - 6 pm), or any time on weekends/holidays/flex-days. However, because we recognize that A-Team members should be able to create a working schedule that is right for them, team members will not be penalized for sending communication outside normal working hours.\n\n## Google\n### G-Mail\nWe communicate largely via email on the A-Team. You should therefore check your email at least once a day during the normal work week. \n\n### G-Calendar\nMuch of our work is communicating and much of that communication comes in the form of meetings. Therefore, you should:    \n\n* [Make your calendar visible](make-calendar-visible.qmd#sec-calendar) to others.    \n* Keep your calendar up-to-date    \n* Add your working location and hours    \n* Add leave and out of office (OOO) to your calendars   \n* Set-up automated OOO message, if OOO for longer than 1 day   \n* Busy/Private appointments during regularly scheduled work hours should only be used for non-work related activities for which there is approved leave, e.g., doctor's appointment, parental duties, etc. Please use \"Focus Time\" or other similar titles to block uninterrupted work time.\n\n\n## Attendance at regularly scheduled events\n\nAttendance, either virtual or in-person, is reasonably expected at:\n\n* [Semimonthly A-Team meetings](intro.qmd#ateam-meetings) \n* [Individual 1:1 with Jason](#intro.qmd#meet-with-Jason) (in-person when possible)    \n* Regularly scheduled project meetings  \n* [NPFM Council Meetings](https://www.npfmc.org/current-or-next-council-meeting/)  \n* FMA All-hands\n\nAttendance is strongly recommended when possible at:    \n\n* AFSC All-Hands    \n* Other Center-wide Meetings\n\n### Tardiness & Absence \nLet's face it - life happens.  Be kind.  If you're going to be late, please notify someone else in the meeting as soon as you realize it and provide a time frame for arrival.  If you know in advance that you aren't going to attedn the meeting, decline on your calendar. \n\n## Expectations of the Program Manager\n\nAs of 2025, Jason Jannot is the FMA Analytical Program Manager.  You can read about his [leadership and management philosophy here](jjphilosophy.qmd#sec-jj-philosophy).\n\nThe Program Manager will (at a minimum) provide the A-Team with:  \n\n* Clarity (the `why?`)    \n* Guidance (the `how?`)    \n* Expectations (the `what?`)    \n* Collaboration & Communication (the `who?`)    \n* Prioritization & Gate-keeping    \n* Accountability    \n* Visibility & Public Recognition    \n* Support Overcoming Barriers    \n* Timely Administrative Support    \n* A Professional and Ethical Role Model\n\n\nIn addition to the above, the Program Manager will (at a minimum) provide individual team members with:  \n\n* Positive feedback & constructive criticism on work  \n* Professional career support and development, including but not limited to:    \n    * opportunities for    \n        * training    \n        * presenting (e.g., conferences, meetings, outreach, etc.)    \n        * publishing\n        * advancing (e.g., promotion, details, etc.)    \n        * collaborating    \n        * leading    \n        * mentoring\n* Regular meetings to discuss work & maintain progress on goals  \n* Empathetic listening    \n* Coaching\n\n##  Expectations of Team Members\n\nA-Team members will (at minimum): \n\n* behave professionally and ethically in all work interactions\n* strive to produce the best science, given the constraints    \n* grow and maintain technical and inter-personal skills\n* share knowledge, experience, code, and time    \n* adopt a [service mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0mzqUMAc20)\n* adopt a [collaborative working mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMG8ObDmbaM)    \n* adapt and be flexible, within reason    \n* communicate clearly and effectively\n* communicate both successes and sticking points regularly    \n* contribute to creating a positive, inclusive, and safe work culture\n\nRemember, as a government agency, we serve the people of the United States and *service* is 1/3^rd^ of [NOAA's mission](https://www.noaa.gov/our-mission-and-vision). Adopting a service mindset when approaching each other, stakeholders, partners, and collaborators will magnify our positive impacts on marine ecosystems, commercial fishing, and the wider world.\n\nSome ways to adopt a service mindset:    \n\n* Share - [code](collaborate.qmd), knowledge, resources, opportunities \n* Serve as a role model    \n* Serve as a resource for other members of the A-Team    \n* Nominate your peers for their hard work and achievements - [AFSC Awards page](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/workforce-management/awards).\n* Participate in outreach activities\n* Mentor others when appropriate, especially new team members \n\n## Team Collaboration and Communication\n\nAlthough the Program Manager is your primary supervisor, everyone should always feel like they can reach out to anyone else on the A-team for help or collaboration.\n\n\n---\n\n<font size=\"2.5\">\"We are Willing to Try\" artwork &copy; Samantha Tustison Snyder, Doodle Art Alley Inc.</font>\n\n\n",

We hope that these on-boarding resources, guidelines, and tips will make your transition to FMA seamless and enjoyable.\n\n[AFSC Onboarding Checklist for Federal and Non-Federal Staff](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gxg-tw76NeptYFkya7M6JSyxsy31mmAu/view?usp=sharing)\n\n\nFor Federal FTEs, check out the following for many good resources:    \n\n[NOAA Fisheries New Hire Employee Resource Group](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/nmfs-erg-newhire/home?authuser=0)    \n[Fisheries New Employee Orientation website](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/inside-fisheries-hc/human-capital/training-and-development/fisheries-onboarding-and-orientation-program)    \n[New Employee Onboarding](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aZcoJooHxNMh4kjCiv4WUgpDtszub1PI)\n\nForeign Nationals should review the [AFSC Interal Foreign Nationals webpage](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/security/foreign-nationals) during their first few days of employment.\n\n</p>\n\n## CAC - Common Access Card\nA CAC will give you access to buildings and computer systems.  It is the necessary first step to getting started.\n\nBoth **Federal and non-Federal employees** will need a CAC.    \n\nForeign Nationals (FN) **are not** assigned a CAC. FNs will need to obtain a [CAC Waiver](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/technology/it-security/cac-waivers). Work with your NOAA Sponsor.\n\n### Get a New CAC\nCAC cards are only issued at Defense Department authorized locations (referred to as \"RAPIDS\" offices) and may or may not be associated with a NOAA facility.  For AFSC staff, the following locations are the closet RAPIDS stations.  \n\n1. Seattle staff = WRC building 1, site ID 105831 (phone: 206-526-6571)\n\n2. Juneau staff = Federal Bldg, site 102444 (phone: 907-463-2170)\n\n### Renew a CAC\n See the [CAC Renewal page](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/security/cac-renewal) on MyAFSC.\n\n### Western Regional Campus (WRC), Seattle, WA\nMost likely you will be assigned space at the WRC campus. The FMA Division is housed in building 4.\n\nAccess for buildings 1, 3 & 4 is Weekdays 0445-2100 (to honor CBA flex hours) and for entering the gate.\n\nGeneral Access (not an employee assigned workspace) for buildings 1, 3,& 4 will be 0600 - 1800 Weekdays.  \n\nThe default gate departure time will be set for 2330.  \n\nThere is no standard weekend access for all employees.  24 / 7 access to campus and buildings required to support missions will be determined on a case-by-case basis with approval from leadership.\n\n \n## IT\n On the first day, an A-Team member (likely Jason), will bring you to OFIS to:  \n  \n  * get computer equipment\n  * set-up accounts (including an Oracle database account)\n  * get logged into NOAA computer & Google account\n  * [request a VPN account](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsites.google.com%2Fnoaa.gov%2Fmyafsc%2Ftechnology%2Fvpn-virtual-private-network&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1YGm7HPymJCqrAYQakwJVj)\n  * download software needed (e.g., R, RStudio, SQL Developer, Endnote)\n  \n#### Confidential Data\nData used by the Analytical Services Program in it's raw^[Raw here could mean the data has gone through QAQC processes as well as other processing. However, the data has **not** been summarized to meet the rule of three.] form is considered to contain confidential information.  As such, you will need to read and sign a Statement of Non-Disclosure (SON).  Work with the PM to get this completed in the early days of on-boarding.    \n\nAll confidential data must be summarized to meet the Rule of Three before being shared with anyone who does not have a current, signed SON on file with FMA.  The rule of three requires that, when data is aggregated, every data point in the aggregated data set includes a minimum of three entities which mask the confidential information in such a way that individual entities cannot be identified or tied to a specific data point.\n\nMore general information on confidential data can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/technology/it-security/privacy-impacts).\n\n#### Other IT Resouces \n[IT Onboarding webpage](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/technology/onboarding-and-clearing-it)    \n[IT Resources](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/technology)    \n[IT Help](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/technology/afsc-it-service-desk)    \n[Software Management and Permission](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/technology/it-security/software-management)\n  \n## General Adminstrative Resources\n\n [General Admin Resources](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/general-admin)\n \n\n## Health & Safety\n\n  Health and safety resources (e.g., reporting an accident) can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/safety).\n\n\n",

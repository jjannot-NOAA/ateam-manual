# Publication Process with AFSC {#sec-publicationprocess}![](_img/contract.png){height=70}

## Style
Please refer to the [AFSC Style Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-F6OHsoRmTkX2x6cXZ3NWwzeFE/view?resourcekey=0-PULR1VmB2gVOuSMDW-YAQA) for questions about style.

Please refer to the [Federal standards for plain language guidelines](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/media/FederalPLGuidelines.pdf) - it's a great resource for how to be a better writer, irrespective of your audience!

Should I use [NMFS or NOAA Fisheries](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-F6OHsoRmTkRzRlbFNXZUU2aGc/view?resourcekey=0-8ApYb_ovfYVj4pLKifk_lg)?

Is it [Fish, Fishery, or Fisheries](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/communications/publications-and-rpts/sorting-fish)?

How do I [cite my AFSC Affiliation](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/communications/publications-and-rpts/citing-affiliation)?

What's the [proper spacing around a degree symbol](https://techwritertemplates.com/documentation/reference/spacing-the-degree-symbol/)?


## RPTS Research Publications Tracking System
Tacking our science is important to you, the Analytical Services Program, AFSC, and NOAA. Science is what we produce and therefore documenting our science through a formal process provides both authors and the organization with a mechanism for recognition and dissemination of our work.

All formal research documents that present data, research, science, analyses, findings or conclusions where an author or co-author cites affiliation with AFSC, must go through review and approval using the RPTS system.

>**Manuscripts destined for review by peer-reviewed journal cannot be submitted to the journal until they have been entered into RPTS and completed the internal review process!**

The [AFSC Intrasite Publications and RPTS](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/communications/publications-and-rpts) describes the process and should be your first resource when moving to publication.

In short the process is as follows:

  1. Submit your manuscript to RPTS.    
  2. Analytical Services Program Manager will complete the Technical Review.    
  3. FMA Division Director will complete the Information Quality Act review.    
  4. Submit to the journal for peer-review.  Follow the peer-review process.    
  5. **IMPORTANT** After publication, log into RPTS and update the status of the publication.    
  6. The final step should submit the publication to the [NOAA Institutional Library](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/welcome) for archiving.

We use Google Docs to set agendas, record decisions, and outline action items during these meetings.\nThe agenda is a single document – this makes finding and referencing old agenda items easier. At the end of each meeting, in prep for the next meeting, the table and agenda outline are copied to the top of the page, the date of the next meeting is added and any items or decisions that were covered and settled or meetings that have passed are removed to make space for the next meeting’s items.\nDuring the time between meetings, staff are expected to:\n\nfill in their updates in the table\n\nreview all the staff updates prior to the meeting and come with any questions\n\nif appropriate, add items to the Discussion, Meetings or other sections of the agenda\n\nScrivener duties for the meeting rotate among A-Team staff and are listed at the bottom of the agenda.\nScrivener Duties The Scrivener is responsible for:\n1. Setting up the page for the next meeting (see above)\n2. Running the meeting and keeping it on time\n3. Documenting discussions and decisions, with help as needed from other attendees\n\n\n\n1:1 with Jason\nEach team member has individual in-person meetings with Jason.\nEach member is responsible for documenting their 1:1 meetings with Jason, including tracking decisions and action items for themselves.

Feedback can be either reinforcing, i.e., it reinforces behaviors or actions that lead to outcomes we want, or redirecting, i.e., it outlines behaviors or actions that lead to unwanted outcomes and provides alternative behaviors or actions that lead to desired outcomes.\nGiving and receiving redirecting feedback can be difficult. However, if we don’t get feedback, we can’t see our own blind-spots. If we don’t provide constructive ways for others to improve, then we can’t expect them to improve and we can’t expect to have our own needs met.\nHealthy, productive teams have members who give each other six (6) or more reinforcing feedback comments for every redirecting feedback comment.\nReward your colleagues for good work and deeds. Here’s some ways to recognize them.\nSimon Sinek has some great advice for how to give difficult feedback (watch at least to the 6:10 mark; but the whole clip is worthwhile).\nEffective communication skills are like muscles, we need to exercise them. You can’t go to the gym for 9 hours and expect to be in shape. But if you go for 30 minutes a day, every day, you will eventually get in shape. Similarly, the first time you try to give or receive feedback in a new way, it might go badly. But eventually it will get better and easier - but never easy.\nNot having a conversation because it will be hard is not an excuse for not having a conversation. Difficult conversations avoided today become tomorrow’s even more difficult conversation.\nThis resource from UBC outlines best practices for giving and receiving feedback.\nHow to Create a Culture of Feedback",

    "text": "Psychological Safety\n\nWhat is Psychological Safety?\nAll members of Analytical Services (including the Program Manager) are expected to conform to a set of behavioral norms that are designed to make the workplace a psychologically and physically safe space.\n\nA norm is a rule that guides behavior toward the usual, typical, and/or standard behavior of a group.\n\nA psychologically safe space is:\n\n“a climate in which people are comfortable expressing and being themselves.” – Amy Edmondson, The Fearless Organization\n\nIn practice, this means that people feel comfortable taking risks, being themselves, speaking their minds, and being openly vulnerable in front of co-workers. The ability to be vulnerable in a workplace is directly related to the consequences that individuals feel they might be subject to if they are openly vulnerable.\nIn a double-blind research study of teams, Google found that the most important feature of highly effective teams was the presence of psychological safety.\n\n\n\nWhy Do We Need Psychological Safety in the Workplace?\nEvidence shows that creating a psychologically safe workplace is strongly linked with highly effective teams1 which are more likely to share ideas, give and welcome feedback, experiment, and discuss mistakes openly1,2. Psychologically safe workplaces are linked to higher employee satisfaction2\n\nBoth images above are from Science for Work.\n\n\nHow Do We Create Psychological Safety in the Workplace?\nTo promote psychological safety, we can:\n\nDevelop self-awareness so that you can adjust your emotional responses and learn to react in a way that invites open discussion.\n\nDemonstrate concern for other team members as people so that they feel comfortable speaking up and showing up as their whole selves.\n\nAsk questions, show appreciation for other’s ideas, and suspend judgement.\n\nEngage in positive dialog to inspire honest conversations.\n\nOwn up to our mistakes and share learnings from failures.\n\n\nSee also the resources for Psychological Safety and Wellness",

Within one week of on-boarding Enterprise Services will create a new profile for you in GovTA.\nYou should:\n\nwork with the Program Manager to set your work schedule\n\nfamiliarize yourself with the definitions and rules around Alternative Work Schedules\n\nfill out an Employee Work Schedule Form\n\nfill out a Telework Application Agreement\n\nfill out a Telework Safety Checklist\nfill out a Telework Application Routing form\ntake Telework Training in the Common Learning Center\n\nTelework Policy for NOAA FTEs - please note the following\n\nYou are currently (2024-06-18) required to be in the office 2 days per pay period.\n\nTelework is a privilege which can be revoked.\n\nIf you are called into the office from telework status for any reason at any time during your normal teleworking hours, your commute to the office is non-work time and should not be recorded on your time sheet.\n\nFor example, your work computer becomes inoperable and AFSC Help Desk indicates that you need to bring it to the AFSC to have it fixed. Your travel time to the AFSC is not to be recorded as work time.\n\n\nForms and information can be found on the myAFSC Time and Attendance page\nTime and Attendance Resources\n\n\nLeave\n\nnon-Federal employees\nGuidance on leave should be provided by your employer.\n\n\nFederal employees\nUse GovTA to request leave. You can find resources related to leave here\nIn 2023, NOAA added a new leave category 66-Administrative Leave - Wellness. The category “…aims to provide workplace liabilities that increase employees’ engagement, retention, and interest in their health and wellness.” (HRGB #1018, FY23). This program allows for up to 40 hours per year of leave to participate in wellness activities during work hours. Below is some guidance, but please see the policy for a complete understanding of the rules and the FAQ for further information.\nAdministrative Leave to participate in wellness activities:\n\nMust be coordinated with, requested to, and approved by your supervisor before being taken.\n\nMust be displayed on your G-calendar.\n\nMust be used in increments of at least 15 minutes.\n\nGenerally may not exceed more than 1 hour on any given work week.\n\nMay be used in conjunction with lunch periods, or at the beginning or end of a workday.\n\nMust be used within the employee’s established work hours.\n\nIs not allowed on the employee’s days off, or while the employee is otherwise on approved leave, or when the employee is on overtime.\n\nMay not be combined with other instances of approved Administrative Leave.\n\nSee the policy for eligibility, employee responsibilities and allowable activities.\n\n\n\nWorking Over-Time (more than 40/80)\n\nnon-Federal employees\nObtain guidance on over-time from your employer.\n\n\nFederal employees\nFor Federal staff, there are three mechanisms for being compensated for working more than 80 hours in a pay period (PP):\n\nOvertime Pay\nCredit hours for those on maxi-flex schedules\nCompensatory time\n\n\nOvertime Pay\nOvertime pay is awarded for working beyond the 80 hours in a pay period. This should not occur often during the year. As best as possible, please work with the Program Manager ahead of time to gain approval for overtime work. If you are on a Maxi-Flex schedule, Credit Hours can be claimed in lieu of overtime pay. Guidelines:\n\nGain approval from Program Manager beforehand\nWork with PM and Timekeeper to fill out paperwork\n\n\n\nCredit Hours\nIf you are on a Maxi-Flex schedule, Credit Hours can be claimed in lieu of overtime pay. Guidelines:\n\nCan carry up to 24 credit hours\n\nNo advance approval is needed\n\nProperly record credit hours on time-sheet\n\nSubmit a Request for Premium Pay in GovTA\n\n\n\nCompensatory Time\nCompensatory time can be awarded for travel that occurs outside or beyond normal working hours or days (e.g., “red-eye” flight, travel on weekend, etc).\nCompensatory time for working (as opposed to traveling) is typically not awarded. Rather, overtime work is typically compensated via overtime pay or credit hours (see above).\nA quick guide for how to claim and record Compensatory Time for traveling can be found here.",

It also includes all interactions among Program staff or any professional interactions outside the Program.\nAs a service Program our most important asset is our relationships!\nProfessional behavior includes, but is not limited to:\n\nAlways using an appropriate tone and volume when speaking. Yelling is almost never necessary, unless there is an emergency or someone is in immediate danger.\n\nAlways using appropriate body language to help emphasize our point. When words and body language send different messages, humans defer to the message in the body language. This means that intimidating body language such as leaning across a desk, getting into someone face, standing up, looming over a person, or beating our chest are all inappropriate behaviors in the workplace. They are counterproductive to getting your message across.\n\nAlways using appropriate language – that means no swearing, no inappropriate or derogatory descriptions of others such as “ignorant”, “idiot”, “stupid”. These create a toxic work environment and they are unnecessary and counterproductive.\n\nAlways work to support each other, not to undermine others. This means we do not “talk trash” or disparage others under any circumstances.\n\nSee also the resources for Psychological Safety and Wellness.",

    "text": "Code Review\n\nPull Request\nA pull request is a request by a collaborator for the repo owner to “pull” the new code into the main branch (or other branch) which will then reflect those changes on the remote repos when others pull that branch down.\n\nPull Request - What are they good for?\nPull request can simplify code review. They are a discussion point between coders. They can be used to:\n\nreview and discuss code: a new feature, improvements, strategy, etc.\naddress issues\nany time new code is added to the repo\n\nWhat are the benefits of pull requests as code review2?\n\nIncreases the quality of the code\nDecreases probability of breaking stuff\nFrees time from micromanaging other peoples code\nReduces the need for meetings\nEmail notifications act as the interface\nThey create a history - all discussion & code (even if it is ultimately rejected), lives on a branch\n\nThe downsides include (see also2):\n1. You have to wait to have your code reviewed by others\n2. Reviewer can get backed up & overwhelmed\n\n\nHow to Submit a Pull Request\n\nGo to the repo, at the top click on Pull Requests\n\nCreate a New Pull Request (green button upper right)\n\nEnsure you are comparing the right branches\n\nLook at the gitdiff\n\nGive it an appropriate succinct title\n\nInclude a descriptive message\n\nWhat has been done\n\nHow to use the new code\n\nWhat someone could do to test the code, e.g., do…\n\n\nCreate the request\n\nAdd a reviewer - upper right hand corner. Will trigger an email.\n\nOnce reviewed, the pull request will be merged with the branch (typically main)\n\nNOTE: You can add more commits to a single pull request, provided it has not been reviewed and merged. However, only do this for very minor changes - missing spaces, typos, missing last lines etc.\n\n\nHow to Review a Pull Request\n\nOpen the pull request\n\nReview the code changes\n\nReviewer - provide comments and feedback as comments\n\nOriginator - respond to comments, perhaps add comments\n\nReviewer - Approve changes (upper right corner) and add approval comment\n\nReviewer - merge pull request\n\nOriginator - delete the branch once the code has been merged. Please do this so that our remote is clean!\n\nDONT FORGET TO PULL the new code to your local instance to get latest code.",

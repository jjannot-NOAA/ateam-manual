Use the Project Planning Template to develop your project. This template has all that is necessary for planning the project.  The outline of the Project Planning Template is as follows.  See the template for instructions and details.    

1. Executive Summary - give an overview of the project and purpose    
2. Project Justification - a brief justification for the project    
3. Project Governance - how tasks are assigned, how conflict is resolved, etc.    
4. Project Scope - what is in versus out of the project    
5. Deliverables    
6. Work Breakdown Structure - Use the Work Breakdown Structure Template to document and assign tasks, develop a project timeline, and a baseline schedule.    
7. Stakeholders - who they are and how they are impacted    
8. Baseline Schedule - an expected timeline to gauge progress against
9. Milestone List - major milestones and expected dates    
10. Change Management Plan - how and who will manage and approve changes to scope    
11. Project Scope Management Plan - who manages and approves scope and final project    
12. Analytical Plan - describe the analyses, statistical methods and plan for technical review of outputs and code
13. Communications Management Plan - who needs to be informed and at what stages and times during the project    
14. Resource Management Plan - what *non-human* resources are needed, include costs if purchases are going to be made.  Include estimates of travel & publication costs.    
15. Human Resources Management Plan - staffing needs, including skills sets and training.

## Tools & Workflow

The A-Team has a singular R package that holds commonly used R custom functions build by the A-Team: [FMAAnalystFunctions](https://github.com/Alaska-Fisheries-Monitoring-Analytics/FMAAnalystFunctions).  For instructions on how to install this package see the [GitHub Repo README](https://github.com/Alaska-Fisheries-Monitoring-Analytics/FMAAnalystFunctions#fma-analyst-functions).

## Debrief/Lessons Learned

<!-- ## Tools -->

<!-- * Keep only 1 working instance     -->
<!-- * Use Github or other version control     -->
<!-- * Document Q&A, e.g., by using Github Issues     -->
<!--   * alternatively use Google Docs to track project history     -->
<!--   * create a minimal reproducible example, aka [repex](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)     -->

<!-- ### Planning -->
<!-- #### Scope - HOW -->
<!-- Developing a detailed description of the project - how will we work? Scope needs to be managed carefully to prevent mission creep. -->

<!-- * How is the scope defined?     -->
<!-- * How is scope validated and controlled?     -->
<!-- * How is scope managed throughout the project?     -->
<!-- * How are requirements planned, tracked, and reported?     -->
<!-- * How are changes in scope and requirements managed?     -->
<!-- * How are priorities defined?     -->
<!-- * How are metrics defined?     -->

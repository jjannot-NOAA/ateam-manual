## Intake & Prioritization

 [Project Intake](Link to be added) <font size="2"> (google sheet) </font>
 
 [FY24 NOAA Priorities](LINK TO BE ADDED)
 
 Projects can be proposed to the A-Team Program Manager at any time by anyone, including A-Team members, FMA staff, AFSC staff, NOAA staff, or any other stakeholders or members of the public (e.g., NPFMC, academic researchers, NGOs, etc.).  The Program Manger's responsibility is to:    
 
  1. document the project on the Project Intake spreadsheet    
  2. prioritize the project, with the help of the FMA Division Director and others    
  3. work with A-Team Staff to assign projects and roles
 
 A large portion of prioritization includes how well the project's goals and objectives align with NOAA Fisheries, AFSC, and FMA priorities and activities which are described in Annual Guidance Memos (NMFS), Strategic Plans (AFSC), and Activity Plans (FMA).  Links to these documents can be found on the [Resources](09-resources.qmd#sec-resources) page of this manual.  In addition to strategic priorities, project prioritization also takes into account the following (higher scores = higher priority):    
 
  * Organizational impact - more parts of the organization that are impacted results in higher score    
  * Stakeholder impact - more stakeholders impacted results in higher score    
  * Feasibility - More feasible projects result in higher score    
  * Time to Completion - Projects that are estimated to have a short time frame result in higher score    
  
## Planning

Use the [Project Planning Template] **INSERT LINK** to develop your project. This template has all that is necessary for planning the project.  The outline of the Project Planning Template is as follows.  See the template for instructions and details. 

Use the [Work Breakdown Structure Template] **INSERT LINK** to document and assign tasks, develop a project timeline, and a baseline schedule.

<!-- 1. Executive Summary - give an overview of the project and purpose     -->
<!-- 2. Project Justification - a brief justification for the project     -->
<!-- 3. Project Governance - how tasks are assigned, how conflict is resolved, etc.     -->
<!-- 4. Project Scope - what is in versus out of the project     -->
<!-- 5. Deliverables     -->
<!-- 6. Work Breakdown Structure - Use the Work Breakdown Structure Template to document and assign tasks, develop a project timeline, and a baseline schedule.     -->
<!-- 7. Stakeholders - who they are and how they are impacted     -->
<!-- 8. Baseline Schedule - an expected timeline to gauge progress against -->
<!-- 9. Milestone List - major milestones and expected dates     -->
<!-- 10. Change Management Plan - how and who will manage and approve changes to scope     -->
<!-- 11. Project Scope Management Plan - who manages and approves scope and final project     -->
<!-- 12. Analytical Plan - describe the analyses, statistical methods and plan for technical review of outputs and code -->
<!-- 13. Communications Management Plan - who needs to be informed and at what stages and times during the project     -->
<!-- 14. Resource Management Plan - what *non-human* resources are needed, include costs if purchases are going to be made.  Include estimates of travel & publication costs.     -->
<!-- 15. Human Resources Management Plan - staffing needs, including skills sets and training.     -->
<!-- 16. Human Resource Requirement Calendar - provide estimates of the time needed for each team member.     -->
<!-- 17. Schedule Management Plan - explain how changes to the schedule will be managed and accomodated to meet project goals     -->
<!-- 18. Quality Management Plan - explain how quality control measures will ensure the final quality of the deliverables     -->
<!-- 19. Risk Management Plan - how will risks be identified, analyzed and mitigated against.  Use a Risk Log to catalog risks.     -->
<!-- 20. Quality Baseline - define success for the project -->



## Tools & Workflow

## NOTE: This section will be completed with input from all Analytical Services Program members during the Analytical Services Program Launch Meeting slated for early 2024.

The A-Team has a singular R package that holds commonly used R custom functions build by the A-Team: [FMAAnalystFunctions](https://github.com/Alaska-Fisheries-Monitoring-Analytics/FMAAnalystFunctions).  For instructions on how to install this package see the [GitHub Repo README](https://github.com/Alaska-Fisheries-Monitoring-Analytics/FMAAnalystFunctions#fma-analyst-functions).

## Completion

## Debrief/Lessons Learned

<!-- ## Tools -->

<!-- * Keep only 1 working instance     -->
<!-- * Use Github or other version control     -->
<!-- * Document Q&A, e.g., by using Github Issues     -->
<!--   * alternatively use Google Docs to track project history     -->
<!--   * create a minimal reproducible example, aka [repex](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)     -->

<!-- ### Planning -->
<!-- #### Scope - HOW -->
<!-- Developing a detailed description of the project - how will we work? Scope needs to be managed carefully to prevent mission creep. -->

<!-- * How is the scope defined?     -->
<!-- * How is scope validated and controlled?     -->
<!-- * How is scope managed throughout the project?     -->
<!-- * How are requirements planned, tracked, and reported?     -->
<!-- * How are changes in scope and requirements managed?     -->
<!-- * How are priorities defined?     -->
<!-- * How are metrics defined?     -->
